its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current through a resistor or a system of resistors connected to the battery We have also seen in Section 112 that to maintain the current the source has to keep expending its energy Where does this energy go A part of the source energy in maintaining the current may be consumed into useful work like in rotating the blades of an electric fan Rest of the source energy may be expended in heat to raise the temperature of gadget We often observe this in our everyday life For example an electric fan becomes warm if used continuously for longer time etc On the other hand if the electric circuit is purely resistive that is a configuration of resistors only connected to a battery the source energy continually gets dissipated entirely in the form of heat This is known as the heating effect of electric current This effect is utilised in devices such as electric heater electric iron etc Consider a current I flowing through a
