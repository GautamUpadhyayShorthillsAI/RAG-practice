huge The process of rusting can be represented by the following equation Iron Fe Oxygen O2 from the air water H2O rust iron oxide Fe2O3 For rusting the presence of both oxygen and water or water vapour is essential In fact if the content of moisture in air is high which means if it is more humid rusting becomes faster So how do we prevent rusting Prevent iron articles from coming in contact with oxygen or water or both One simple way is to apply a coat of paint or grease In fact these coats should be applied regularly to prevent rusting Another way is to deposit a layer of a metal like chromium or zinc on iron A protective shield You must have heard of the ozone layer in our atmosphere It protects us from the harmful ultraviolet radiation which come from the sun Ozone absorbs this radiation and breaks down to oxygen Oxygen is different from ozone Can we call the breaking down of ozone a chemical change If ultraviolet radiation were not absorbed by ozone it would reach the earths
