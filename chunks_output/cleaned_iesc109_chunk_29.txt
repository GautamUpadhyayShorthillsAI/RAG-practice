law applies to objects anywhere in the universe Such a law is said to be universal Gravitation is a weak force unless large masses are involved The force of gravity decreases with altitude It also varies on the surface of the earth decreasing from poles to the equator The weight of a body is the force with which the earth attracts it The weight is equal to the product of mass and acceleration due to gravity The weight may vary from place to place but the mass stays constant When a body is immersed fully or partially in a fluid it experiences an upward force that is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by it Now can you explain why a further decrease in the elongation of the string was not observed in activity 97 as the stone was fully immersed in water Archimedes was a Greek scientist He discovered the principle subsequently named after him after noticing that the water in a bathtub overflowed when he stepped into it He ran through the streets shouting Eureka which means I have
