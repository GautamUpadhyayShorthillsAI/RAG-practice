body organisation simple reproductive methods can still work Spirogyra for example simply breaks up into smaller pieces upon maturation These pieces or fragments grow into new individuals Can we work out the reason for this based on what we saw in Activity 74 This is not true for all multicellular organisms They cannot simply divide cellbycell The reason is that many multicellular organisms as we have seen are not simply a random collection of cells Specialised cells are organised as tissues and tissues are organised into organs which then have to be placed at definite positions in the body In such a carefully organised situation cellbycell division would be impractical Multicellular organisms therefore need to use more complex ways of reproduction A basic strategy used in multicellular organisms is that different cell types perform different specialised functions Following this general pattern reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific cell type How is
