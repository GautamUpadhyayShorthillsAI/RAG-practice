A B and C based on your observations Do your predictions match your observations What do you conclude from this activity Fig 103 Direction of growth of root and shoot under different conditions Upright plant kept in sunlight from one direction Inverted plant kept in sunlight from all directions b c a Inner view of the box Hole on the back side of the box Upright plant kept in sunlight from all directions From the results of this experiment Table 103 and Fig 103 we note that 1 When the plant is kept upright the root grows downwards and the shoot grows upwards Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 6 194 2 When the plant is kept inverted the root bends and grows downwards Also the shoot bends and grows upwards 3 When the plant gets sunlight only from one direction the shoot grows in the direction of light while the root continues to grow downwards After conducting Activity 103 we can conclude that shoots of plants grow upward and exhibit movement towards sunlight but roots of plants grow
