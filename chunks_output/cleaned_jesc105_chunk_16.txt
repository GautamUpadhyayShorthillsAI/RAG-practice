system is different in various organisms In singlecelled organisms the food may be taken in by the entire surface But as the complexity of the organism increases different parts become specialised to perform different functions For example Amoeba takes in food using temporary fingerlike extensions of the cell surface which fuse over the food particle forming a foodvacuole Fig 55 Inside the food vacuole complex substances are broken down into simpler ones which then diffuse into the cytoplasm The remaining undigested material is moved to the surface of the cell and thrown out In Paramoecium which is also a unicellular organism the cell has a definite shape and food is taken in at a specific spot Food is moved to this spot by the movement of cilia which cover the entire surface of the cell 524 Nutrition in Human Beings The alimentary canal is basically a long tube extending from the mouth to the anus In Fig 56 we can see that the tube has different parts Various regions are specialised
