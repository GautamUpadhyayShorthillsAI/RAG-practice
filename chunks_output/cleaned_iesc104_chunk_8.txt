the fencing and no sound would be heard This is because there are lots of gaps in the fence which allow the stone to pass through them Following a similar reasoning Rutherford concluded from the particle scattering experiment that i Most of the space inside the atom is empty because most of the particles passed through the gold foil without getting deflected ii Very few particles were deflected from their path indicating that the positive charge of the atom occupies very little space iii A very small fraction of particles were deflected by 1800 indicating that all the positive charge and mass of the gold atom were concentrated in a very small volume within the atom From the data he also calculated that the radius of the nucleus is about 105 times less than the radius of the atom On the basis of his experiment Rutherford put forward the nuclear model of an atom which had the following features i There is a positively charged centre in an atom called the nucleus Nearly all the mass of
