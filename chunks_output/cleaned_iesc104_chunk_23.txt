by this model Neils Bohrs model of the atom was more successful He proposed that electrons are distributed in different shells with discrete energy around the nucleus If the atomic shells are complete then the atom will be stable and less reactive J Chadwick discovered presence of neutrons in the nucleus of an atom So the three subatomic particles of an atom are i electrons ii protons and iii neutrons Electrons are negatively charged protons are positively charged and neutrons have no charges The mass of an electron is about 1 2000 times the mass of an hydrogen atom The mass of a proton and a neutron is taken as one unit each Shells of an atom are designated as KLMN Valency is the combining capacity of an atom The atomic number of an element is the same as the number of protons in the nucleus of its atom The mass number of an atom is equal to the number of nucleons in its nucleus Isotopes are atoms of the same element which have different mass numbers Isobars are atoms having the same
