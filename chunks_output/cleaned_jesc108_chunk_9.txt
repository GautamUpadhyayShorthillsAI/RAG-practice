both TT and Tt are tall plants while only tt is a short plant In other words a single copy of T is enough to make the plant tall while both copies have to be t for the plant to be short Traits like T are called dominant traits while those that behave like t are called recessive traits Work out which trait would be considered dominant and which one recessive in Fig 84 202425 Heredity 131 x RR yy round green rr YY wrinkled yellow Ry rY Rr Yy round yellow F1 x Rr Yy F1 Rr Yy F1 315 round yellow 108 round green 101 wrinkled yellow 32 wrinkled green 9 3 3 1 556 seeds 16 RY Ry rY ry RY Ry rY ry RRYY RRYy RrYY RrYy RRYy RRyy RrYy Rryy RrYY RrYy rrYY rrYy RrYy Rryy rrYy rryy F2 Figure 85 Figure 85 Figure 85 Figure 85 Figure 85 Independent inheritance of two separate traits shape and colour of seeds What happens when pea plants showing two different characteristics rather than just one are bred with each other What do the progeny of a tall plant with round seeds and a short plant with
