by a and known as nuclear membrane 3 Chromosome 3 More than one single chromosome 4 Membranebound 4 cell organelles absent 525 CELL ORGANELLES Every cell has a membrane around it to keep its own contents separate from the external environment Large and complex cells including cells from multicellular organisms need a lot of chemical activities to support their complicated structure and function To keep these activities of different kinds separate from each other these cells use membranebound little structures or organelles within themselves This is one of the features of the eukaryotic cells that distinguish them from prokaryotic cells Some of these organelles are visible only with an electron microscope We have talked about the nucleus in a previous section Some important examples of cell organelles which we will discuss now are endoplasmic reticulum Golgi apparatus lysosomes mitochondria and plastids They are important because they carry out some very crucial functions in cells 525
