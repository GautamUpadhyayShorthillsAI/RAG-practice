in Classes VI and VII It is involved in the fixation of nitrogen in leguminous plants pulses Recall that Rhizobium lives in the root nodules of leguminous plants Fig 29 such as beans and peas with which it has a symbiotic relationship Sometimes nitrogen gets fixed through the action of lightning But you know that the amount of nitrogen in the atmosphere remains constant You may wonder how Let us understand this in the next section Why does the milk that comes in packets not spoil My mother told me that the milk is pasteurised What is pasteurisation 202425 MICROORGANISMS FRIEND AND FOE 27 nitrogen cannot be taken directly by plants and animals Certain bacteria and blue green algae present in the soil fix nitrogen from the atmosphere and convert it into compounds of nitrogen Once nitrogen is converted into these usable compounds it can be utilised by plants from the soil through their root system Nitrogen is then used for the synthesis of plant proteins and other compounds Animals
