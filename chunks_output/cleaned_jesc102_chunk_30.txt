Cl2g H2g Chlorine gas is given off at the anode and hydrogen gas at the cathode Sodium hydroxide solution is formed near the cathode The three products produced in this process are all useful Figure 28 shows the different uses of these products Bleaching powder You have already come to know that chlorine is produced during the electrolysis of aqueous sodium chloride brine This chlorine gas is used for the manufacture of bleaching powder Bleaching powder is produced by the action of chlorine on dry slaked lime CaOH2 Bleaching powder is represented as CaOCl2 though the actual composition is quite complex CaOH2 Cl2 CaOCl2 H2O Figure 28 Figure 28 Figure 28 Figure 28 Figure 28 Important products from the chloralkali process 202425 Acids Bases and Salts 31 Bleaching powder is used i for bleaching cotton and linen in the textile industry for bleaching wood pulp in paper factories and for bleaching washed clothes in laundry ii as an oxidising agent in many chemical industries and iii to make
