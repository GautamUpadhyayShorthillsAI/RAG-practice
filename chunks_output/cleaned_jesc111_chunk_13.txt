electric circuit A component used to regulate current without changing the voltage source is called variable resistance In an electric circuit a device called rheostat is often used to change the resistance in the circuit We will now study about electrical resistance of a conductor with the help of following Activity 202425 Electricity 177 In this Activity we observe that the current is different for different components Why do they differ Certain components offer an easy path for the flow of electric current while the others resist the flow We know that motion of electrons in an electric circuit constitutes an electric current The electrons however are not completely free to move within a conductor They are restrained by the attraction of the atoms among which they move Thus motion of electrons through a conductor is retarded by its resistance A component of a given size that offers a low resistance is a good conductor A conductor having some appreciable resistance is called a
