IX This phenomenon is seen when a fine beam of sunlight enters a smokefilled room through a small hole Thus scattering of light makes the particles visible Tyndall effect can also be observed when sunlight passes through a canopy of a dense forest Here tiny water droplets in the mist scatter light The colour of the scattered light depends on the size of the scattering particles Very fine particles scatter mainly blue light while particles of larger size scatter light of longer wavelengths If the size of the scattering particles is large enough then the scattered light may even appear white 1062 Why is the colour of the clear Sky Blue The molecules of air and other fine particles in the atmosphere have size smaller than the wavelength of visible light These are more effective in scattering light of shorter wavelengths at the blue end than light of longer wavelengths at the red end The red light has a wavelength about 18 times greater than blue light Thus when sunlight passes through
