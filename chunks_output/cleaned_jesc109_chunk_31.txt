of the line under the glass slab appear bent n Look at the line from the top of the glass slab Does the part of the line beneath the slab appear to be raised Why does this happen 931 Refraction through a Rectangular Glass Slab To understand the phenomenon of refraction of light through a glass slab let us do an Activity 202425 Light Reflection and Refraction 147 In this Activity you will note the light ray has changed its direction at points O and O Note that both the points O and O lie on surfaces separating two transparent media Draw a perpendicular NN to AB at O and another perpendicular MM to CD at O The light ray at point O has entered from a rarer medium to a denser medium that is from air to glass Note that the light ray has bent towards the normal At O the light ray has entered from glass to air that is from a denser medium to a rarer medium The light here has bent away from the normal Compare the angle of incidence with the angle of refraction at both refracting surfaces AB
