state is called melting The process of conversion of liquid into solid state is called freezing Let us check the connection between different states of water through Activity 86 Activity 86 Let us complete the diagram Fill up the blank boxes in Fig 85 marked as A B C and 1 2 3 4 for conversion of different states of water using the words given in the box Two words have been filled for you Liquid Freezes Evaporates Gas Condenses 3 4 Melts 1 2 Solid A B C Fig 85 Conversion of different states of water Atmospheric Water Generator AWG machines collect water from humid air to produce drinkable water This is done through condensation of water vapour More to know by cooling the air This process is similar to the formation of drops of water outside the glass tumbler filled with ice cold water A Journey through States of Water 153 85 How can Water be Evaporated Faster or Slower In section 81 we have learnt about evaporation Let us explore it more Observe your surroundings What are the
