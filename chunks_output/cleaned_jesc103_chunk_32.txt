into oxides by heating strongly in the presence of excess air This process is known as roasting The carbonate ores are changed into oxides by heating strongly in limited air This process is known as calcination The chemical reaction that takes place during roasting and calcination of zinc ores can be shown as follows Roasting 2ZnSs 3O g 2ZnOs 2SO g 2 2 Heat Calcination ZnCO s ZnOs CO g 3 2 Heat The metal oxides are then reduced to the corresponding metals by using suitable reducing agents such as carbon For example when zinc oxide is heated with carbon it is reduced to metallic zinc ZnOs Cs Zns COg You are already familiar with the process of oxidation and reduction explained in the first Chapter Obtaining metals from their compounds is also a reduction process Besides using carbon coke to reduce metal oxides to metals sometimes displacement reactions can also be used The highly reactive metals such as sodium calcium aluminium etc are used as reducing 202425 Science 52 agents because
