speed of the car is vav 400 km 8 h s t 50 km h1 Q 202425 MOTION 77 77 77 77 77 To answer such a question we have to introduce another physical quantity called acceleration which is a measure of the change in the velocity of an object per unit time That is acceleration change in velocity time taken If the velocity of an object changes from an initial value u to the final value v in time t the acceleration a is v u a t 73 This kind of motion is known as accelerated motion The acceleration is taken to be positive if it is in the direction of velocity and negative when it is opposite to the direction of velocity The SI unit of acceleration is m s2 If an object travels in a straight line and its velocity increases or decreases by equal amounts in equal intervals of time then the acceleration of the object is said to be uniform The motion of a freely falling body is an example of uniformly accelerated motion On the other hand an object can travel with nonuniform acceleration if its velocity
