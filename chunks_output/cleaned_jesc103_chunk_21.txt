with a number of reagents Why do metals react in this manner Let us recall what we learnt about the electronic configuration of elements in Class IX We learnt that noble gases which have a completely filled valence shell show little chemical activity We therefore explain the reactivity of elements as a tendency to attain a completely filled valence shell Let us have a look at the electronic configuration of noble gases and some metals and nonmetals We can see from Table 33 that a sodium atom has one electron in its outermost shell If it loses the electron from its M shell then its L shell now becomes the outermost shell and that has a stable octet The nucleus of this atom still has 11 protons but the number of electrons has become 10 so there is a net positive charge giving us a sodium cation Na On the other hand chlorine has seven electrons in its outermost shell Use the Table above to answer the following questions about metals A B C and D i Which is the most reactive metal ii What
