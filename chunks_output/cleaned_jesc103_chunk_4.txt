Do you know why these metals are used for making vessels Let us do the following Activity to find out the answer Activity 35 Activity 35 Activity 35 Activity 35 Activity 35 n Take an aluminium or copper wire Clamp this wire on a stand as shown in Fig 31 n Fix a pin to the free end of the wire using wax n Heat the wire with a spirit lamp candle or a burner near the place where it is clamped n What do you observe after some time n Note your observations Does the metal wire melt The above activity shows that metals are good conductors of heat and have high melting points The best conductors of heat are silver and copper Lead and mercury are comparatively poor conductors of heat Do metals also conduct electricity Let us find out Figure 31 Figure 31 Figure 31 Figure 31 Figure 31 Metals are good conductors of heat 202425 Metals and Nonmetals 39 You must have seen that the wires that carry current in your homes have a coating of polyvinylchloride PVC or a rubberlike material Why are electric
