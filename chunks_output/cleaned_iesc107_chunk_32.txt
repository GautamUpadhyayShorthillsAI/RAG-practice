If the athlete moves with a velocity of constant magnitude along the circular path the only change in his velocity is due to the change in the direction of motion The motion of the athlete moving along a circular path is therefore an example of an accelerated motion We know that the circumference of a circle of radius r is given by 2 r If the athlete takes t seconds to go once around the circular path of radius r the speed v is given by 2 r v t 78 When an object moves in a circular path with uniform speed its motion is called uniform circular motion a Rectangular track b Hexagonal track d A circular track c Octagonal shaped track Fig 78 The motion of an athlete along closed tracks of different shapes Let us consider an example of the motion of a body along a closed path Fig 89 a shows the path of an athlete along a rectangular track ABCD Let us assume that the athlete runs at a uniform speed on the 202425 SCIENCE 84 Activity Activity Activity Activity Activity 711 711 711 711 711 Take
