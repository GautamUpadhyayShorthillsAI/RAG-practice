will stay the same size 3 If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell meaning that it is a very concentrated solution the cell will lose water by osmosis Such a solution is known as a hypertonic solution Again water crosses the cell membrane in both directions but this time more water leaves the cell than enters it Therefore the cell will shrink Thus osmosis is a special case of diffusion through a selectively permeable membrane Now let us try out the following activity Activity 53 Osmosis with an egg a Remove the shell of an egg by dissolving it in dilute hydrochloric acid The shell is mostly calcium carbonate A thin outer skin now encloses the egg Put the egg in pure water and observe after 5 minutes What do we observe The egg swells because water passes into it by osmosis b Place a similar deshelled egg in a concentrated salt solution and observe for 5 minutes The egg shrinks Why Water passes out of the egg solution into the salt solution because the salt
