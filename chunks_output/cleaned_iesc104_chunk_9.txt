i There is a positively charged centre in an atom called the nucleus Nearly all the mass of an atom resides in the nucleus ii The electrons revolve around the nucleus in circular paths iii The size of the nucleus is very small as compared to the size of the atom Drawbacks of Rutherfords model of the atom The revolution of the electron in a circular orbit is not expected to be stable Any particle in a circular orbit would undergo acceleration During acceleration charged particles would radiate energy Thus the revolving electron would lose energy and finally fall into the nucleus If this were so the atom should be highly unstable and hence matter would not exist in the form that we know We know that atoms are quite stable E Rutherford 18711937 was born at Spring Grove on 30 August 1871 He was known as the Father of nuclear physics He is famous for his work on radioactivity and the discovery of the nucleus of an atom with the gold foil experiment He got the Nobel prize in chemistry in
