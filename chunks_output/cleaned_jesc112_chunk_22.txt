observed that 202425 Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 203 the direction of force acting on the currentcarrying rod gets reversed It shows that the direction of the force on the conductor depends upon the direction of current and the direction of the magnetic field Experiments have shown that the displacement of the rod is largest or the magnitude of the force is the highest when the direction of current is at right angles to the direction of the magnetic field In such a condition we can use a simple rule to find the direction of the force on the conductor In Activity 127 we considered the direction of the current and that of the magnetic field perpendicular to each other and found that the force is perpendicular to both of them The three directions can be illustrated through a simple rule called Flemings lefthand rule According to this rule stretch the thumb forefinger and middle finger of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular Fig 1213 If the first finger points
