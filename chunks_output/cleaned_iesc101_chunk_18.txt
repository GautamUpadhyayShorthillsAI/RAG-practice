greater speed The energy supplied by heat overcomes the forces of attraction between the particles The particles leave their fixed positions and start moving more freely A stage is reached when the solid melts and is converted to a liquid The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point The melting point of a solid is an indication of the strength of the force of attraction between its particles The melting point of ice is 27315 K The process of melting that is change of solid state into liquid state is also known as fusion When a solid melts its temperature remains the same so where does the heat energy go You must have observed during the experiment of melting that the temperature of the system does not change after the melting point is reached till all the ice melts This happens even though we continue to heat the beaker that is we continue to supply heat This heat gets used up in changing the state by
