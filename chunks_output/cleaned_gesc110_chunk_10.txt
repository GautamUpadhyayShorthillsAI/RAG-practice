produced in a wire depends on its material length and thickness Thus for different requirements the wires of different materials and different lengths and thicknesses are used The wires used for making electric circuits do not normally become hot On the other hand the elements of some electric appliances become so hot that they are easily visible The filament of Fig 1012 Glowing filament of an electric bulb incandescent Incandescent electric bulbs Fig 1012 are often used for lighting but they also give heat It means that a part of electricity consumed is used in producing heat This is not desirable as it results in the wastage of electricity The fluorescent tubelights and compact fluorescent lamps CFLs are better electricity efficient lighting sources Nowadays the use of light emitting diode LED bulbs is increasing For producing a given intensity of light LED bulbs consume less electricity as compared to incandescent bulbs or fluorescent tubes or CFLsThus LED bulbs are much
