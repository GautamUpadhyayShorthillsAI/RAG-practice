it appears as if the plant is moving Let us understand this type of movement with the help of an example 202425 Control and Coordination 107 Environmental triggers such as light or gravity will change the directions that plant parts grow in These directional or tropic movements can be either towards the stimulus or away from it So in two different kinds of phototropic movement shoots respond by bending towards light while roots respond by bending away from it How does this help the plant Plants show tropism in response to other stimuli as well The roots of a plant always grow downwards while the shoots usually grow upwards and away from the earth This upward and downward growth of shoots and roots respectively in response to the pull of earth or gravity is obviously geotropism Fig 66 If hydro means water and chemo refers to chemicals what would hydrotropism and chemotropism mean Can we think of examples of these kinds of directional growth movements One example of chemotropism is the
