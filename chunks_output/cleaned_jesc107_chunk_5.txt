during reproduction is the basis for evolution as we will discuss in the next chapter 711 The Importance of Variation Populations of organisms fill welldefined places or niches in the ecosystem using their ability to reproduce The consistency of DNA copying during reproduction is important for the maintenance of body design features that allow the organism to use that particular niche Reproduction is therefore linked to the stability of populations of species However niches can change because of reasons beyond the control of the organisms Temperatures on earth can go up or down water levels can vary or there could be meteorite hits to think of a few examples If a population of reproducing organisms were suited to a particular niche and if the niche were drastically altered the population could be wiped out However if some variations were to be present in a few individuals in these populations there would be some chance for them to survive Thus if there were a population of bacteria
