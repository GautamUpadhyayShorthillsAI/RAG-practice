that pressure is force per unit area If we imagine a unit area and a very long cylinder standing on it filled with air then the force of gravity on the air in this cylinder is the atmospheric pressure Fig 817 Fig 818 A rubber sucker pressed on a surface When you press the sucker most of the air between its cup and the surface escapes out The sucker sticks to the surface because the pressure of atmosphere acts on it To pull the sucker off the surface the applied force should be large enough to overcome the atmospheric pressure This activity might give you an idea about the magnitude of atmospheric pressure In fact it would not be possible for any human being to pull the sucker off the But how large or small is the atmospheric pressure Let us get an idea about its magnitude Activity 811 Take a good quality rubber sucker It looks like a small rubber cup Fig 818 Press it hard on a smooth plane surface Does it stick to the surface Now try to pull it off the surface Can you do it 202425
