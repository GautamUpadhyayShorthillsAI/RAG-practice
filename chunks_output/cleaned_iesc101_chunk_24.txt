If the surface area is increased the rate of evaporation increases For example while putting clothes for drying up we spread them out an increase of temperature With the increase of temperature more number of particles get enough kinetic energy to go into the vapour state a decrease in humidity Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in air The air around us cannot hold more than a definite amount of water vapour at a given temperature If the amount of water in air is already high the rate of evaporation decreases an increase in wind speed It is a common observation that clothes dry faster on a windy day With the increase in wind speed the particles of water vapour move away with the wind decreasing the amount of water vapour in the surrounding 152 HOW DOES EVAPORATION CAUSE COOLING In an open vessel the liquid keeps on evaporating The particles of liquid absorb energy from the surrounding to regain the energy lost during evaporation This absorption of energy from the
