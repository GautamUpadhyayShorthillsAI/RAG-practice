Fig 73 Fig 73 Distancetime graph of an object moving with uniform speed We know that when an object travels equal distances in equal intervals of time it moves with uniform speed This shows that the distance travelled by the object is directly proportional to time taken Thus for uniform speed a graph of distance travelled against time is a straight line as shown in Fig 73 The portion OB of the graph shows that the distance is increasing at a uniform rate Note that you can also use the term uniform velocity in place of uniform speed if you take the magnitude of displacement equal to the distance travelled by the object along the yaxis We can use the distancetime graph to determine the speed of an object To do so consider a small part AB of the distancetime graph shown in Fig 73 Draw a line parallel to the xaxis from point A and another line parallel to the yaxis from point B These two lines meet each other at point C to form a triangle ABC Now on the graph AC denotes the time interval
