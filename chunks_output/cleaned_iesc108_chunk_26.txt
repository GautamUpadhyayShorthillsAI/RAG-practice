second object instantaneously exerts a force back on the first These two forces are always equal in magnitude but opposite in direction These forces act on different objects and never on the same object In the game of football sometimes we while looking at the football and trying to kick it with a greater force collide with a player of the opposite team Both feel hurt because each applies a force to the other In other words there is a pair of forces and not just one force The two opposing forces are also known as action and reaction forces Let us consider two spring balances connected together as shown in Fig 810 The fixed end of balance B is attached with a rigid support like a wall When a force is applied through the free end of spring balance A it is observed that both the spring balances show the same readings on their scales It means that the force exerted by spring balance A on balance B is equal but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the balance B on balance A Any of
