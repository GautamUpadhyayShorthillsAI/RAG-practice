Sewage is a liquid waste which causes water and soil pollution Wastewater is treated in a sewage treatment plant Treatment plants reduce pollutants in wastewater to a level where nature can take care of it Where underground sewerage systems and refuse disposal systems are not available the low cost onsite sanitation system can be adopted Byproducts of wastewater treatment are sludge and biogas Open drain system is a breeding place for flies mosquitoes and organisms which cause diseases We should not defecate in the open It is possible to have safe disposal of excreta by low cost methods here It must be disposed of properly otherwise epidemics could break out The government has laid down certain standards of sanitation but unfortunately they are not strictly enforced However all of us can contribute in maintaining sanitation at public places We should not scatter litter anywhere If there is no dustbin in sight we should carry the litter home and throw it in the dustbin Conclusion We
