the products and the metal surface cool down n Which metals burn easily n What flame colour did you observe when the metal burnt n How does the metal surface appear after burning n Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of their reactivity towards oxygen n Are the products soluble in water Almost all metals combine with oxygen to form metal oxides Metal Oxygen Metal oxide For example when copper is heated in air it combines with oxygen to form copperII oxide a black oxide 2Cu O2 2CuO Copper CopperII oxide Similarly aluminium forms aluminium oxide 4Al 3O2 2Al2O3 Aluminium Aluminium oxide Recall from Chapter 2 how copper oxide reacts with hydrochloric acid We have learnt that metal oxides are basic in nature But some metal oxides such as aluminium oxide zinc oxide show both acidic as well as basic behaviour Such metal oxides which react with both acids as well as bases to produce salts and water are known as amphoteric oxides Aluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids
