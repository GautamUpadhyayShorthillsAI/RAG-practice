an element occurs in isotopic forms then we have to know the percentage of each isotopic form and then the average mass is calculated This does not mean that any one atom of chlorine has a fractional mass of 355 u It means that if you take a certain amount of chlorine it will contain both isotopes of chlorine and the average mass is 355 u Applications Since the chemical properties of all the isotopes of an element are the same normally we are not concerned about taking a mixture But some isotopes have special properties which find them useful in various fields Some of them are i An isotope of uranium is used as a fuel in nuclear reactors ii An isotope of cobalt is used in the treatment of cancer iii An isotope of iodine is used in the treatment of goitre 461 ISOBARS Let us consider two elements calcium atomic number 20 and argon atomic number 18 The number of protons in these atoms is different but the mass number of both these elements is 40 That is the total number of nucleons is
