of the reaction You must have observed that magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling white flame and changes into a white powder This powder is magnesium oxide It is formed due to the reaction between magnesium and oxygen present in the air 202425 Chemical Reactions and Equations 3 111 Writing a Chemical Equation Is there any other shorter way for representing chemical equations Chemical equations can be made more concise and useful if we use chemical formulae instead of words A chemical equation represents a chemical reaction If you recall formulae of magnesium oxygen and magnesium oxide the above wordequation can be written as Mg O2 MgO 12 Count and compare the number of atoms of each element on the LHS and RHS of the arrow Is the number of atoms of each element the same on both the sides If yes then the equation is balanced If not then the equation is unbalanced because the mass is not the same on both sides of the equation Such a chemical equation is a skeletal chemical equation for
