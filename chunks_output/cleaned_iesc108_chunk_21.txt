catching the fast moving ball Fig 88 is also reduced If the ball is stopped suddenly then its high velocity decreases to zero in a very short interval of time Thus the rate of change of momentum of the ball will be large Therefore a large force would have to be applied for holding the catch that may hurt the palm of the fielder In a high jump athletic event the athletes are made to fall either on a cushioned bed or on a sand bed This is to increase the time of the athletes fall to stop after making the jump This decreases the rate of change of momentum and hence the force Try to ponder how a karate player breaks a slab of ice with a single blow The first law of motion can be mathematically stated from the mathematical expression for the second law of motion Eq 84 is F ma or F m v u t 85 or Ft mv mu That is when F 0 v u for whatever time t is taken This means that the object will continue moving with uniform velocity u throughout the time t If u is zero then v will also be zero That is
