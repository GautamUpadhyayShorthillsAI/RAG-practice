Thomson Even before the electron was identified E Goldstein in 1886 discovered the presence of new radiations in a gas discharge and called them canal rays These rays were positively charged radiations which ultimately led to the discovery of another subatomic particle This subatomic particle had a charge equal in magnitude but opposite in sign to that of the electron Its mass was approximately 2000 times as that of the electron It was given the name of proton In general an electron is represented as e and a proton as p The mass of a proton is taken as one unit and its charge as plus one The mass of an electron is considered to be negligible and its charge is minus one It seemed that an atom was composed of protons and electrons mutually balancing their charges It also appeared that the protons were in the interior of the atom for whereas electrons could easily be removed off but not protons Now the big question was what sort of structure did these particles of the atom form We will
