as the stone is gradually lowered in the water However no further change is observed once the stone gets fully immersed in the water What do you infer from the decrease in the extension of the string or the reading of the spring balance We know that the elongation produced in the string or the spring balance is due to the weight of the stone Since the extension decreases once the stone is lowered in water it means that some force acts on the stone in upward direction As a result the net force on the string decreases and hence the elongation also decreases As discussed earlier this upward force exerted by water is known as the force of buoyancy What is the magnitude of the buoyant force experienced by a body Is it the same in all fluids for a given body Do all bodies in a given fluid experience the same buoyant force The answer to these questions is contained in Archimedes principle stated as follows Activity 96 Take a beaker filled with water Take a piece of cork and an iron nail of
