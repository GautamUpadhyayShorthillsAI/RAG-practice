and Repulsion between Magnets Activity 45 Let us experiment Take a pair of bar magnets on which North and South poles have been marked Mark the two bar magnets as A and B Place the longer side of magnet A over 56 round shaped pencils as shown in Fig 48a Now bring one end of magnet B near the end of magnet A placed on the pencils Make sure that the two magnets do not touch each other Observe what happens Next bring the other end of magnet B near the same end of magnet A Fig 48b Does the magnet A on the pencils begin to move Does it always move in the direction of the approaching magnet What do these observations suggest You will see that unlike poles of two magnets that is the North pole of one magnet and the South pole of another magnet attract each other The like poles that is either the North poles or the South poles of both magnets repel each other Magnet A Magnet B Magnet A Magnet B Fig 48 Interaction between two bar magnets a b Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 6 68 Repeat the
