the heater draw if the potential difference is increased to 120 V Solution We are given potential difference V 60 V current I 4 A According to Ohms law 60 V 15 4 A V R I When the potential difference is increased to 120 V the current is given by current 120 V 8 A 15 V R The current through the heater becomes 8 A Example 115 Resistance of a metal wire of length 1 m is 26 at 20C If the diameter of the wire is 03 mm what will be the resistivity of the metal at that temperature Using Table 112 predict the material of the wire Solution We are given the resistance R of the wire 26 the diameter d 03 mm 3 104 m and the length l of the wire 1 m Therefore from Eq 1110 the resistivity of the given metallic wire is RAl Rd24l Substitution of values in this gives 184 106 m The resistivity of the metal at 20C is 184 106 m From Table 112 we see that this is the resistivity of manganese Example 116 A wire of given material having length l and area of crosssection A has a resistance of 4 What would be
