This is usually an elaborate and extensive irrigation system In this system canals receive water from one or more reservoirs or from rivers The main canal is divided into branch canals having further distributaries to irrigate fields River Lift Systems In areas where canal flow is insufficient or irregular due to inadequate reservoir release the lift system is more rational Water is directly drawn from the rivers for supplementing irrigation in areas close to rivers Tanks These are small storage reservoirs which intercept and store the runoff of smaller catchment areas Fresh initiatives for increasing the water available for agriculture include rainwater harvesting and watershed management This involves building small checkdams which lead to an increase in ground water levels The checkdams stop the rainwater from flowing away and also reduce soil erosion 1212 iii CROPPING PATTERNS Different ways of growing crops can be used to give maximum benefit Mixed cropping is growing two or more
