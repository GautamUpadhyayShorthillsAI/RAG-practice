to the mass say m of the object that is W m It is due to this reason that at a given place we can use the weight of an object as a measure of its mass The mass of an object remains the same everywhere that is on the earth and on any planet whereas its weight depends on its location because g depends on location 941 WEIGHT OF AN OBJECT ON THE MOON We have learnt that the weight of an object on the earth is the force with which the earth attracts the object In the same way the weight of an object on the moon is the force with which the moon attracts that object The mass of the moon is less than that of the earth Due to this the moon exerts lesser force of attraction on objects Let the mass of an object be m Let its weight on the moon be Wm Let the mass of the moon be Mm and its radius be Rm By applying the universal law of gravitation the weight of the object on the moon will be 2 G m m m M m W R 916 Let the weight of the same object on the earth be We The mass of the earth is M and its
