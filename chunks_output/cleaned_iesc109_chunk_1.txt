SCIENCE 100 We have learnt about the motion of objects and force as the cause of motion We have learnt that a force is needed to change the speed or the direction of motion of an object We always observe that an object dropped from a height falls towards the earth We know that all the planets go around the Sun The moon goes around the earth In all these cases there must be some force acting on the objects the planets and on the moon Isaac Newton could grasp that the same force is responsible for all these This force is called the gravitational force In this chapter we shall learn about gravitation and the universal law of gravitation We shall discuss the motion of objects under the influence of gravitational force on the earth We shall study how the weight of a body varies from place to place We shall also discuss the conditions for objects to float in liquids 91 Gravitation We know that the moon goes around the earth An object when thrown upwards reaches a certain height and then
