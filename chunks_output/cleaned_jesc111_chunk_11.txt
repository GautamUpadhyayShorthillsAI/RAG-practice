increases the potential difference across the wire increases linearly this is Ohms law Activity 112 Activity 112 Activity 112 Activity 112 Activity 112 n Take a nichrome wire a torch bulb a 10 W bulb and an ammeter 0 5 A range a plug key and some connecting wires n Set up the circuit by connecting four dry cells of 15 V each in series with the ammeter leaving a gap XY in the circuit as shown in Fig 114 In this Activity you will find that approximately the same value for VI is obtained in each case Thus the VI graph is a straight line that passes through the origin of the graph as shown in Fig 113 Thus VI is a constant ratio In 1827 a German physicist Georg Simon Ohm 17871854 found out the relationship between the current I flowing in a metallic wire and the potential difference across its terminals The potential difference V across the ends of a given metallic wire in an electric circuit is directly proportional to the current flowing through it provided its temperature remains the
