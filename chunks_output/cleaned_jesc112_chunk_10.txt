A simple electric circuit in which a straight copper wire is placed parallel to and over a compass needle The deflection in the needle becomes opposite when the direction of the current is reversed a b Activity 125 Activity 125 Activity 125 Activity 125 Activity 125 n Take a battery 12 V a variable resistance or a rheostat an ammeter 05 A a plug key connecting wires and a long straight thick copper wire n Insert the thick wire through the centre normal to the plane of a rectangular cardboard Take care that the cardboard is fixed and does not slide up or down 202425 Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 199 What happens to the deflection of the compass needle placed at a given point if the current in the copper wire is changed To see this vary the current in the wire We find that the deflection in the needle also changes In fact if the current is increased the deflection also increases It indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given point increases as the
