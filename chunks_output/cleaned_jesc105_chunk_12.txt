activity which demonstrates that chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis 202425 Life Processes 83 Now let us study how the plant obtains carbon dioxide In Class IX we had talked about stomata Fig 53 which are tiny pores present on the surface of the leaves Massive amounts of gaseous exchange takes place in the leaves through these pores for the purpose of photosynthesis But it is important to note here that exchange of gases occurs across the surface of stems roots and leaves as well Since large amounts of water can also be lost through these stomata the plant closes these pores when it does not need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis The opening and closing of the pore is a function of the guard cells The guard cells swell when water flows into them causing the stomatal pore to open Similarly the pore closes if the guard cells shrink n Take two healthy potted plants which are nearly the same size n Keep them in a dark room for three days n Now place each plant on separate glass
