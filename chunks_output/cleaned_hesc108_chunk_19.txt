a charged body The force exerted by a charged body on another charged or uncharged body is known as electrostatic force This force comes into play even when the bodies are not in contact The electrostatic force therefore is another example of a noncontact force You will learn more about electric charges in Gravitational Force You know that a coin or a pen falls to the ground when it slips off your hand Leaves and fruits also fall to the ground when they get detached from the plant Have you ever wondered why it is so When the coin is held in your hand it is at rest As soon as it is released it begins to move downwards It is clear that the state of motion of the coin undergoes a change Can this happen without a force acting on it Which is this force Does the magnet on the rollers begin to move when the other magnet is brought near it Does it always move in the direction of the approaching magnet What do these observations suggest Does it mean that some force must be acting between the
