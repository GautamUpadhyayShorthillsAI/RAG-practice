the acidic solution by ions Acids contain H ion as cation and anion such as Cl in HCl NO3 in HNO3 SO2 4 in H2SO4 CH3COO in CH3COOH Since the cation present in acids is H this suggests that acids produce hydrogen ions Haq in solution which are responsible for their acidic properties Repeat the same Activity using alkalis such as sodium hydroxide calcium hydroxide etc What can you conclude from the results of this Activity 221 What Happens to an Acid or a Base in a Water Solution Do acids produce ions only in aqueous solution Let us test this Activity 29 Activity 29 Activity 29 Activity 29 Activity 29 n Take about 1g solid NaCl in a clean and dry test tube and set up the apparatus as shown in Fig 24 n Add some concentrated sulphuric acid to the test tube n What do you observe Is there a gas coming out of the delivery tube n Test the gas evolved successively with dry and wet blue litmus paper n In which case does the litmus paper change colour n On the basis of the above Activity what do
