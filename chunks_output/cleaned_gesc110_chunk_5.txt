a battery is shown in Table101 Let us now draw a circuit diagram of an electric circuit using symbols shown in Table 101 Activity 101 Make the electric circuit shown in Fig 107 You used a similar circuit in Class VI to make an electric bulb glow Do you remember that the bulb glows only when the switch is in the ON position The bulb glows as soon as the switch is moved to the ON position Copy this electric circuit in your notebook Make also a circuit diagram of this circuit using symbols for the various electric components Is your diagram similar to the one shown in Fig 108 It is much easier to draw a circuit diagram using symbols Therefore we generally represent an electric circuit by its circuit diagram Fig 109 shows another circuit diagram Is it identical to the circuit diagram shown in Fig108 In which way is it different Would the bulb glow in this electric circuit Recall that the bulb glows only when the switch is in the ON position and the electric circuit is closed Fig 104 A
