motion One of the most wellknown periodic motions is that of a simple pendulum In everyday life we seldom find objects moving with a constant speed over long distances or for long durations of time If the speed of an object moving along a straight line keeps changing its motion is said to be nonuniform On the other hand an object moving along a straight line with a constant speed is said to be in uniform motion In this case the average speed is the same as the actual speed Fig 93 Some common clocks b Table clock c Digital clock a Wall clock a constant speed or not during that hour The speed calculated here is actually the average speed of the car In this book we shall use the term speed for average speed So for us the speed is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken Thus Total distance covered Speed Total time taken Reprint 202425 MOTION AND TIME 95 A simple pendulum consists of a small metallic ball or a piece of stone suspended from a rigid stand by a thread Fig
