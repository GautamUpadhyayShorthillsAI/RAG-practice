portions which produce the germcells and other portions that deliver the germcells to the site of fertilisation The formation of germcells or sperms takes place in the testes These are located outside the abdominal cavity in scrotum because sperm formation requires a lower temperature than the normal body temperature We have discussed the role of the testes in the secretion of the hormone testosterone in the previous chapter In addition to regulating the formation of sperms testosterone brings about changes in appearance seen in boys at the time of puberty The sperms formed are delivered through the vas deferens which unites with a tube coming from the urinary bladder The urethra thus forms a common passage for both the sperms and urine Along the path of the vas deferens glands like the prostate and the seminal vesicles add their secretions so that the sperms are now in a fluid which makes their transport easier and this fluid also provides nutrition The sperms are tiny bodies that
