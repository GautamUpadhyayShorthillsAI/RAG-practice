wear in summer Q 202425 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 11 The arrangement of particles is most ordered in the case of solids in the case of liquids layers of particles can slip and slide over each other while for gases there is no order particles just move about randomly The states of matter are interconvertible The state of matter can be changed by changing temperature or pressure Sublimation is the change of solid state directly to gaseous state without going through liquid state Deposition is the change of gaseous state directly to solid state without going through liquid state Boiling is a bulk phenomenon Particles from the bulk whole of the liquid change into vapour state Evaporation is a surface phenomenon Particles from the surface gain enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction present in the liquid and change into the vapour state The rate of evaporation depends upon the surface area exposed to the atmosphere the temperature the humidity and the wind speed Evaporation
