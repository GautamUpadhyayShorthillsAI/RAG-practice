acceleration of the bicycle in both the cases Solution Solution Solution Solution Solution In the first case initial velocity u 0 final velocity v 6 m s1 time t 30 s From Eq 83 we have v u a t Substituting the given values of uv and t in the above equation we get 1 1 6m s 0m s 30 s a 02 m s2 In the second case initial velocity u 6 m s1 final velocity v 4 m s1 time t 5 s Then 1 1 4m s 6m s 5 s a 04 m s2 The acceleration of the bicycle in the first case is 02 m s2 and in the second case it is 04 m s2 uestions 1 When will you say a body is in i uniform acceleration ii non uniform acceleration 2 A bus decreases its speed from 80 km h1 to 60 km h1 in 5 s Find the acceleration of the bus 3 A train starting from a railway station and moving with uniform acceleration attains a speed 40 km h1 in 10 minutes Find its acceleration Q 202425 SCIENCE 78 78 78 78 78 74 Graphical Representation of Motion Graphs provide a convenient method to present basic information about a variety of events For
