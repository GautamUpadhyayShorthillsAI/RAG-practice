the plant often secrete a waxy water resistant layer on their outer surface This aids in protection against loss of water mechanical injury and invasion by parasitic fungi Since it has a protective role to play cells of epidermal tissue form a continuous layer without intercellular spaces Most epidermal cells are relatively flat Often their outer and side walls are thicker than the inner wall We can observe small pores here and there in the epidermis of the leaf These pores are called stomata Fig 65 Stomata are enclosed by two kidneyshaped cells called guard cells They are necessary for exchanging gases with the atmosphere Transpiration loss of water in the form of water vapour also takes place through stomata 202425 SCIENCE 64 Recall which gas is required for photosynthesis Find out the role of transpiration in plants Epidermal cells of the roots whose function is water absorption commonly bear long hair like parts that greatly increase the total absorptive surface area In some
