too surprising Let us try it out Remember not to switch on the current for more than a few seconds at a time The electromagnet weakens the cell quickly if left connected Reprint 202425 SCIENCE 118 the electromagnet There is a contact screw near the iron strip When the iron strip is in contact with the screw the current flows through the coil which becomes an electromagnet It then pulls the iron strip In the process the hammer at the end of the strip strikes the gong of the bell to produce a sound However when the electromagnet pulls the iron strip it also breaks the circuit The current through the coil stops flowing Will the coil remain an electromagnet The coil is no longer an electromagnet It no longer attracts the iron strip The iron strip comes back to its original position and touches the contact screw again This completes the circuit The current flows in the coil and the hammer strikes the gong again This process is repeated in quick succession The hammer strikes the gong every
