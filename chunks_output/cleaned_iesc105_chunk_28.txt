ATP generating chemical reactions The energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of ATP Adenosine triphopshate molecules ATP is known as the energy currency of the cell The body uses energy stored in ATP for making new chemical compounds and for mechanical work Mitochondria are strange organelles in the sense that they have their own DNA and ribosomes Therefore mitochondria are able to make some of their own proteins 525 V PLASTIDS Plastids are present only in plant cells There are two types of plastids chromoplasts coloured plastids and leucoplasts white or colourless plastids Chromoplasts containing the pigment chlorophyll are known as chloroplasts Chloroplasts are important for photosynthesis in plants Chloroplasts also contain various yellow or orange pigments in addition to chlorophyll Leucoplasts are primarily organelles in which materials such as starch oils and protein granules are stored The internal organisation of
