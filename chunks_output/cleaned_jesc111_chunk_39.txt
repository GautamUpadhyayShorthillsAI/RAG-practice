heating is also used to produce light as in an electric bulb Here the filament must retain as much of the heat generated as is possible so that it gets very hot and emits light It must not melt at such high temperature A strong metal with high melting point such as tungsten melting point 3380C is used for making bulb filaments The filament should be thermally isolated as much as possible using insulating support etc The bulbs are usually filled with chemically inactive nitrogen and argon gases to prolong the life of filament Most of the power consumed by the filament appears as heat but a small part of it is in the form of light radiated Another common application of Joules heating is the fuse used in electric circuits It protects circuits and appliances by stopping the flow of any unduly high electric current The fuse is placed in series with the device It consists of a piece of wire made of a metal or an alloy of appropriate melting point for example aluminium copper iron lead etc
