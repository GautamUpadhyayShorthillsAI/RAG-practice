Number Q Symbol of element Atomic Number For example nitrogen is written as 14 7 N uestions 1 If number of electrons in an atom is 8 and number of protons is also 8 then i what is the atomic number of the atom and ii what is the charge on the atom 2 With the help of Table 41 find out the mass number of oxygen and sulphur atom 46 Isotopes In nature a number of atoms of some elements have been identified which have the same atomic number but different mass numbers For example take the case of hydrogen atom it has three atomic species namely protium 1 1H deuterium 2 1 H or D and tritium 3 1H or T The atomic number of each one is 1 but the mass number is 1 2 and 3 respectively Other such examples are i carbon 12 6 C and 14 6 C ii chlorine 35 17 Cl and 37 17 Cl etc On the basis of these examples isotopes are defined as the atoms of the same element having the same atomic number but different mass numbers Therefore we can say that there are three isotopes of hydrogen atom namely protium
