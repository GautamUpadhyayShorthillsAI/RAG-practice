cation Mg2 first followed by the symbol of anion Cl Then their charges are crisscrossed to get the formula 4 Formula of magnesium chloride Formula MgCl2 Thus in magnesium chloride there are two chloride ions Cl for each magnesium ion Mg2 The positive and negative charges must balance each other and the overall structure must be neutral Note that in the formula the charges on the ions are not indicated Some more examples a Formula for aluminium oxide Formula Al2O3 b Formula for calcium oxide Here the valencies of the two elements are the same You may arrive at the formula Ca2O2 But we simplify the formula as CaO The rules that you have to follow while writing a chemical formula are as follows the valencies or charges on the ion must balance when a compound consists of a metal and a nonmetal the name or symbol of the metal is written first For example calcium oxide CaO sodium chloride NaCl iron sulphide FeS copper oxide CuO etc where oxygen chlorine sulphur are non metals and are
