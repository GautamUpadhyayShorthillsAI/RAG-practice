of atoms attached to different carbon chains These compounds were initially extracted from natural substances and it was thought that these carbon compounds or organic compounds could only be formed within a living system That is it was postulated that a vital force was necessary for their synthesis Friedrich Whler disproved this in 1828 by preparing urea from ammonium cyanate But carbon compounds except for carbides oxides of carbon carbonate and hydrogencarbonate salts continue to be studied under organic chemistry 421 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds 421 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds 421 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds 421 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds 421 Saturated and Unsaturated Carbon Compounds We have already seen the structure of methane Another compound formed between carbon and hydrogen is ethane with a formula of C2H6 In order to arrive at the structure of simple carbon compounds the first step is to link the carbon atoms
