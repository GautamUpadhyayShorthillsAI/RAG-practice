corresponding to the time 815 AM on the xaxis Fig 914 Suppose this point is A Next we draw a line perpendicular to the xaxis or parallel to the yaxis at point A We then mark the point T on the graph at which this perpendicular line intersects it Fig 914 Next we draw a line through the point T parallel to the xaxis This intersects the yaxis at the point B The distance corresponding to the point B on the y axis OB gives us the distance in km covered by the bus at 815 AM How much is this distance in km Can you now help Paheli to find the distance moved by the bus at 945 AM Can you also find the speed of the bus from its distancetime graph Bar graph Graphs Nonuniform motion Keywords Oscillation Simple pendulum Speed Time period Uniform motion Unit of time What you have Learnt The distance moved by an object in a unit time is called its speed Speed of objects help us to decide which one is moving faster than the other The speed of an object is the distance travelled divided by the time
