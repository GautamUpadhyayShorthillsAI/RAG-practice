flows in a wire Even if the current is small the deflection of the magnetic needle can be seen Can we make a tester using the magnetic effect of currents Let us find out in Activity 113 Join the free ends of two wires momentarily The compass needle should show deflection Your tester with two free ends of the wire is ready Now repeat Activity 112 using this tester Do you find a deflection in the compass needle the moment you dip the free ends of the tester in lemon juice Take out the ends of the tester from the lemon juice dip them in water and then wipe them dry Repeat the activity with other liquids such as tap water vegetable oil milk honey Remember to wash and wipe dry the ends of tester after testing each liquid In each case observe whether the magnetic needle shows deflection or not Record your observations in Table 111 You may use an LED Fig 113 in place of the electric bulb in the tester of Fig 112 LED glows even when a weak electric current flows through it There are two wires
