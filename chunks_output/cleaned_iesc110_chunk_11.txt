An object that possesses energy can exert a force on another object When this happens energy is transferred from the former to the latter The second object may move as it receives energy and therefore do some work Thus the first object had a capacity to do work This implies that any object that possesses energy can do work The energy possessed by an object is thus measured in terms of its capacity of doing work The unit of energy is therefore the same as that of work that is joule J 1 J is the energy required to do 1 joule of work Sometimes a larger unit of energy called kilo joule kJ is used 1 kJ equals 1000 J 1021 FORMS OF ENERGY Luckily the world we live in provides energy in many different forms The various forms include mechanical energy potential energy kinetic energy heat energy chemical energy electrical energy and light energy Think it over How do you know that some entity is a form of energy Discuss with your friends and teachers Work done W F s mg s 15 kg 10 m s2 15 m 225
