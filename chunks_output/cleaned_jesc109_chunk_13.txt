size with respect to the object size n Repeat the activity by placing the candle a just beyond C b at C c between F and C d at F and e between P and F n In one of the cases you may not get the image on the screen Identify the position of the object in such a case Then look for its virtual image in the mirror itself n Note down and tabulate your observations 202425 Science 138 You will see in the above Activity that the nature position and size of the image formed by a concave mirror depends on the position of the object in relation to points P F and C The image formed is real for some positions of the object It is found to be a virtual image for a certain other position The image is either magnified reduced or has the same size depending on the position of the object A summary of these observations is given for your reference in Table 91 Table 91 Image formation by a concave mirror for different positions of the object Position of the Position of the Size of the Nature of the object
