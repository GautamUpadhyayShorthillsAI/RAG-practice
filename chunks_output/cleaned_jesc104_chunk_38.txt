cold climates This gave rise to its name glacial acetic acid The group of organic compounds called carboxylic acids are obviously characterised by their acidic nature However unlike mineral acids like HCl which are completely ionised carboxylic acids are weak acids Activity 47 Activity 47 Activity 47 Activity 47 Activity 47 n Compare the pH of dilute acetic acid and dilute hydrochloric acid using both litmus paper and universal indicator n Are both acids indicated by the litmus test n Does the universal indicator show them as equally strong acids Activity 48 Activity 48 Activity 48 Activity 48 Activity 48 n Take 1 mL ethanol absolute alcohol and 1 mL glacial acetic acid along with a few drops of concentrated sulphuric acid in a test tube n Warm in a waterbath for at least five minutes as shown in Fig 411 n Pour into a beaker containing 2050 mL of water and smell the resulting mixture Reactions of ethanoic acid Reactions of ethanoic acid Reactions of ethanoic acid Reactions of ethanoic
