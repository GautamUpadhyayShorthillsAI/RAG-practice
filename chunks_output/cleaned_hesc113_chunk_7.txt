bend the paper you create a plane different from the plane in which the incident ray and the normal lie Then you do not see the reflected ray What does it indicate It indicates that the incident ray the normal at the point of incidence and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane This is another law of reflection Paheli and Boojho performed the above activities outside the classroom a 202425 SCIENCE 168 appear to come from the point I Since the reflected rays do not actually meet at I but only appear to do so we say that a virtual image of the point O is formed at I As you have learnt already in Class VII such an image cannot be obtained on a screen You may recall that in an image formed by a mirror the left of the object appears on the right and the right appears on the left This is known as lateral inversion 133 Regular and Diffused Reflection Activity 134 Imagine that parallel rays are incident on an irregular surface as shown in Fig 136 Remember that the laws of reflection are
