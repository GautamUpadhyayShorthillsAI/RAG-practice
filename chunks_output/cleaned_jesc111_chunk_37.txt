the time for which the current flows through the resistor In practical situations when an electric appliance is connected to a known voltage source Eq 1121 is used after calculating the current through it using the relation I VR Example 1110 An electric iron consumes energy at a rate of 840 W when heating is at the maximum rate and 360 W when the heating is at the minimum The voltage is 220 V What are the current and the resistance in each case Solution From Eq 1119 we know that the power input is P V I Thus the current I PV a When heating is at the maximum rate I 840 W220 V 382 A and the resistance of the electric iron is R VI 220 V382 A 5760 b When heating is at the minimum rate I 360 W220 V 164 A and the resistance of the electric iron is R VI 220 V164 A 13415 Example 1111 100 J of heat is produced each second in a 4 resistance Find the potential difference across the resistor Solution H 100 J R 4 t 1 s V From Eq 1121 we have the current through the resistor as I HRt 100 J4 1 s 5 A
