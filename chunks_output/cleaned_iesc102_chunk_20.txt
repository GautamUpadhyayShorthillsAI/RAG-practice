with magnetic properties Can we separate the components of the material obtained On adding dilute sulphuric acid or dilute hydrochloric acid did both the groups obtain a gas Did the gas in both the cases smell the same or different The gas obtained by Group I is hydrogen it is colourless odourless and combustible it is not advised to do the combustion test for hydrogen in the class The gas obtained by Group II is hydrogen sulphide It is a colourless gas with the smell of rotten eggs You must have observed that the products obtained by both the groups show different properties though the starting materials were the same Group I has carried out the activity involving a physical change whereas in case of Group II a chemical change a chemical reaction has taken place The material obtained by group I is a mixture of the two substances The substances given are the elementsiron and sulphur The properties of the mixture are the same as that of its constituents The number of elements known at
