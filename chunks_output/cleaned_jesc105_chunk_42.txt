lymph vessels that finally open into larger veins Lymph carries digested and absorbed fat from intestine and drains excess fluid from extra cellular space back into the blood 542 Transportation in Plants We have discussed earlier how plants take in simple compounds such as CO2 and photosynthesise energy stored in their chlorophyllcontaining organs namely leaves The other kinds of raw materials needed for building plant bodies will also have to be taken up separately For plants the soil is the nearest and richest source of raw materials like nitrogen phosphorus and other minerals The absorption of these substances therefore occurs through the part in contact with the soil namely roots If the distances between soilcontacting organs and chlorophyll containing organs are small energy and raw materials can easily diffuse to all parts of the plant body But if these distances become large because of changes in plant body design diffusion processes will not be sufficient to provide raw
