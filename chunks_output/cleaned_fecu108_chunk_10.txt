tumbler through condensation There is an increase in the reading on the digital weighing balance Can we conclude that water is not seeping through the wall of the tumbler Can we also conclude that the water collected outside the tumbler is only due to condensation No we cannot say that conclusively from Activity 84 What more can you do to show that water is not seeping from the glass tumbler How would you modify Activity 84 to find the answer Repeat Activity 84 with the following modifications Mark the water level on the glass tumbler with a permanent marker or a visible tape What do you observe Water level in the glass tumbler does not go down but the extra water gets collected on the outer surface of the glass tumbler What can you conclude Table 82 Measurement of mass in condensation experiment using a digital weighing balance Time Mass of water 0 min 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min 25 min 30 min The amount of water vapour in the air is also known as humidity The daily humidity data for
