positions in a direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation When we drop a pebble in a pond the waves you see on the water surface is an example of transverse wave Light is a transverse wave but for light the oscillations are not of the medium particles or their pressure or density it is not a mechanical wave You will come to know more about transverse waves in higher classes 1122 CHARACTERISTICS OF A SOUND WAVE We can describe a sound wave by its frequency amplitude and speed Q A sound wave in graphic form is shown in Fig 116c which represents how density and pressure change when the sound wave moves in the medium The density as well as the pressure of the medium at a given time varies with distance above and below the average value of density and pressure Fig 116a and b a Fig 115 Longitudinal wave in a slinky 202425 SCIENCE 130 Heinrich Rudolph Hertz was born on 22 February 1857 in Hamburg Germany and educated at the University of Berlin He confirmed JC Maxwells
