Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 6 154 What can you conclude from this investigation If you spread out water on a plate its area exposed to air is larger Therefore evaporation is faster What would happen if milk is taken instead of water in the above activity Other conditions which affect how fast water evaporates Design an activity similar to Activity 87 to find out what are the other conditions which can affect how fast water will evaporate What would you change What would you keep the same Perform this activity use Table 85 to record the data and discuss your observations Other than the conditions you have explored to find how water can be made to evaporate faster or slower you can also conduct Activity 88 to explore it further Table 84 Findings of the investigation Exposed area of water Time taken for complete evaporation Less bottle cap More plate Reflect on what you did really well in this activity Condition that is kept the same Table 85 Record the data of an investigation
