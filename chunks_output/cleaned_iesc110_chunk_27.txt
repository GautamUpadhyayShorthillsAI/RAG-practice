of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy 202425 SCIENCE 122 A stronger person may do certain work in relatively less time A more powerful vehicle would complete a journey in a shorter time than a less powerful one We talk of the power of machines like motorbikes and motorcars The speed with which these vehicles change energy or do work is a basis for their classification Power measures the speed of work done that is how fast or slow work is done Power is defined as the rate of doing work or the rate of transfer of energy If an agent does a work W in time t then power is given by Power worktime or W P t 108 The unit of power is watt in honour of James Watt 1736 1819 having the symbol W 1 watt is the power of an agent which does work at the rate of 1 joule per second We can also say that power is 1 W when the rate of consumption of energy is 1 J s1 1 watt 1 joulesecond or 1 W 1 J s1 We express larger rates of energy transfer in kilowatts kW 1 kilowatt 1000 watts 1 kW 1000 W
