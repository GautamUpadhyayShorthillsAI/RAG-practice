are incident on an irregular surface as shown in Fig 136 Remember that the laws of reflection are valid at each point of the surface Use these laws to construct reflected rays at various points Are they parallel to one another You will find that these rays are reflected in different directions Fig 137 When all the parallel rays reflected from a rough or irregular surface are not parallel the reflection is known as diffused or irregular reflection Remember that the diffused reflection is not due to the failure of the laws of reflection It is caused by the irregularities in the reflecting surface like that of a cardboard On the other hand reflection from a smooth surface like that of a mirror is called regular reflection Fig 138 Images are formed by regular reflection Fig 135 Image formation in a plane mirror Fig 136 Parallel rays incident on an irregular surface Fig 137 Rays reflected from irregular surface Fig 138 Regular reflection 202425 LIGHT 169 Let us find out 134 Reflected Light
