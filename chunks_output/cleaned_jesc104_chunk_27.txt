i Ethanoic acid ii Bromopentane iii Butanone iv Hexanal Are structural isomers possible for bromopentane 5 How would you name the following compounds i CH3CH2Br ii iii 43 CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF CARBON COMPOUNDS In this section we will be studying about some of the chemical properties of carbon compounds Since most of the fuels we use are either carbon or its compounds we shall first study combustion 431 Combustion 431 Combustion 431 Combustion 431 Combustion 431 Combustion Carbon in all its allotropic forms burns in oxygen to give carbon dioxide along with the release of heat and light Most carbon compounds also release a large amount of heat and light on burning These are the oxidation reactions that you learnt about in the first Chapter i C O2 CO2 heat and light ii CH4 O2 CO2 H2O heat and light iii CH3CH2OH O2 CO2 H2O heat and light Balance the latter two reactions like you learnt in the first Chapter Activity 43 Activity 43 Activity 43 Activity 43 Activity 43 CAUTION This Activity
