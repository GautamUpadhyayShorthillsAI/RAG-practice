the gong again This process is repeated in quick succession The hammer strikes the gong every time the circuit is completed This is how the bell rings Keywords Battery Circuit diagram Electric components Electric bell Electromagnet Fuse Heating effect of current Magnetic effect of current What you have learnt It is convenient to represent electric components by symbols Using these an electric circuit can be represented by a circuit diagram When an electric current flows through a wire the wire gets heated It is the heating effect of current This effect has many applications the eye Many toys also have electromagnets inside them 105 ELECTRIC BELL We are quite familiar with an electric bell It has an electromagnet in it Let us see how it works Fig 1020 shows the circuit of an electric bell It consists of a coil of wire wound on an iron piece The coil acts as an electromagnet An iron strip with a hammer at one end is kept close to Fig 10 20 Circuit of an electric bell Reprint 202425
