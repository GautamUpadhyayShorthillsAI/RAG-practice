the copper wire vertically between the points X and Y as shown in Fig 126 a in series with the battery a plug and key n Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly on the cardboard You may use a salt sprinkler for this purpose n Keep the variable of the rheostat at a fixed position and note the current through the ammeter n Close the key so that a current flows through the wire Ensure that the copper wire placed between the points X and Y remains vertically straight n Gently tap the cardboard a few times Observe the pattern of the iron filings You would find that the iron filings align themselves showing a pattern of concentric circles around the copper wire Fig 126 n What do these concentric circles represent They represent the magnetic field lines n How can the direction of the magnetic field be found Place a compass at a point say P over a circle Observe the direction of the needle The direction of the north pole of the compass needle would give the direction of the field lines produced
