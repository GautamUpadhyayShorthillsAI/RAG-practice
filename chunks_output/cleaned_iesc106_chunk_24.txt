the ability to respond to stimuli However cells of the nervous tissue are highly specialised for being stimulated and Muscles contain special proteins called contractile proteins which contract and relax to cause movement Fig 611 Types of muscles fibres a striated muscle b smooth muscle c cardiac muscle We can move some muscles by conscious will Muscles present in our limbs move when we want them to and stop when we so decide Such muscles are called voluntary muscles c Striations Nuclei Spindle shaped muscle cell Nucleus b Nuclei Striations a 202425 TISSUES 69 processes called dendrites An individual nerve cell may be up to a metre long Many nerve fibres bound together by connective tissue make up a nerve The signal that passes along the nerve fibre is called a nerve impulse Nerve impulses allow us to move our muscles when we want to The functional combination of nerve and muscle tissue is fundamental to most animals This combination enables animals to move rapidly in response to
