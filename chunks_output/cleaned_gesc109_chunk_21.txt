to distance 1 km on the yaxis The point where these two lines intersect represents this set of values on the graph Fig 912 Similarly mark on the graph paper the points corresponding to different sets of values Fig 912 shows the set of points on the graph corresponding to positions of the car at various times Join all the points on the graph as shown in Fig 913 It is a straight line This is the distancetime graph for the motion of the car If the distancetime graph is a straight line it indicates that the object is moving with a constant speed However if the speed of the object keeps changing the graph can be of any other shape Fig 912 Making a graph Fig 913 Making a graph O X Y X O Y Reprint 202425 MOTION AND TIME 103 Generally the choice of scales is not as simple as in the example given in Fig 912 and 913 We may have to choose two different scales to represent the desired quantities on the xaxis and the yaxis Let us try to understand this process with an example Let us again consider
