direction of motion along with its speed The quantity that specifies both these aspects is called velocity Velocity is the speed of an object moving in a definite direction The velocity of an object can be uniform or variable It can be changed by changing the objects speed direction of motion or both When an object is moving along a straight line at a variable speed we can express the magnitude of its rate of motion in terms of average velocity It is calculated in the same way as we calculate average speed In case the velocity of the object is changing at a uniform rate then average velocity is given by the arithmetic mean of initial velocity and final velocity for a given period of time That is average velocity initial velocity final velocity 2 Mathematically v av u v 2 72 where vav is the average velocity u is the initial velocity and v is the final velocity of the object Speed and velocity have the same units that is m s1 or ms Activity 76 Measure the time it takes you to walk from
