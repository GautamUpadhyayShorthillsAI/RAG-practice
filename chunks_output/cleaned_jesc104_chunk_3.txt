We saw that ionic compounds have high melting and boiling points and conduct electricity in solution or in the molten state We also 202425 Carbon and its Compounds 59 saw how the nature of bonding in ionic compounds explains these properties Let us now study the properties of some carbon compounds Most carbon compounds are poor conductors of electricity as we have seen in Chapter 2 From the data given in Table 41 on the boiling and melting points of the carbon compounds we find that these compounds have low melting and boiling points as compared to ionic compounds Chapter 3 We can conclude that the forces of attraction between the molecules are not very strong Since these compounds are largely nonconductors of electricity we can conclude that the bonding in these compounds does not give rise to any ions In Class IX we learnt about the combining capacity of various elements and how it depends on the number of valence electrons Let us now look at the electronic configuration of carbon
