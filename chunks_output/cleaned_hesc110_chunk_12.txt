You have already learnt in earlier classes about the oscillatory motion and its time period The number of oscillations per second is called the frequency of oscillation Frequency is expressed in hertz Its symbol is Hz A frequency of 1 Hz is one oscillation per second If an object oscillates 20 times in one second what would be its frequency You can recognise many familiar sounds without seeing the objects producing them How is it possible These sounds must be different to enable you to recognise them Have you ever thought what factors make them different Amplitude and frequency are two important properties of any sound Can we differentiate sounds on the basis of their amplitudes and frequencies Loudness and Pitch Activity 1011 Take a metallic tumbler and a tablespoon Strike the tablespoon gently at the brim of the tumbler Fig 1016 Human ear Fig 1017 Thermocol ball touching the vibrating glass tumbler We must NEVER put a sharp pointed or hard thing into our ear It can damage the
