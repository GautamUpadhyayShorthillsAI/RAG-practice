irrespective of the source But the sounds we receive are different This is due to the different characteristics associated with the sound Pitch is one of the characteristics 1 v T Fig 117 Low pitch sound has low frequency and high pitch of sound has high frequency Fig 118 Soft sound has small amplitude and louder sound has large amplitude 202425 SCIENCE 132 Q Q uestions 1 Which wave property determines a loudness b pitch 2 Guess which sound has a higher pitch guitar or car horn The speed of sound is defined as the distance which a point on a wave such as a compression or a rarefaction travels per unit time We know speed v distance time T Example 111 A sound wave has a frequency of 2 kHz and wave length 35 cm How long will it take to travel 15 km Solution Given Frequency 2 kHz 2000 Hz Wavelength 35 cm 035 m We know that speed v of the wave wavelength frequency v 035 m 2000 Hz 700 ms The time taken by the wave to travel a distance d of 15 km is Thus sound will take 21 s to travel a
