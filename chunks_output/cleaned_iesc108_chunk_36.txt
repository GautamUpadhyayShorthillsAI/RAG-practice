Is it constant increasing decreasing or zero b What do you infer about the forces acting on the object A2 Two persons manage to push a motorcar of mass 1200 kg at a uniform velocity along a level road The same motorcar can be pushed by three persons to produce an acceleration of 02 m s2 With what force does each person push the motorcar Assume that all persons push the motorcar with the same muscular effort A3 A hammer of mass 500 g moving at 50 m s1 strikes a nail The nail stops the hammer in a very short time of 001 s What is the force of the nail on the hammer A4 A motorcar of mass 1200 kg is moving along a straight line with a uniform velocity of 90 kmh Its velocity is slowed down to 18 kmh in 4 s by an unbalanced external force Calculate the acceleration and change in momentum Also calculate the magnitude of the force required 202425
