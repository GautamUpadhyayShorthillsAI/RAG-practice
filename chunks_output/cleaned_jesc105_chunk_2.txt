of life is not enough Movements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye movements of molecules for example Is this invisible molecular movement necessary for life If we ask this question to professional biologists they will say yes In fact viruses do not show any molecular movement in them until they infect some cell and that is partly why there is a controversy about whether they are truly alive or not Why are molecular movements needed for life We have seen in earlier classes that living organisms are wellorganised structures they can have tissues tissues have cells cells have smaller components in them and so on Because of the effects of the environment this organised ordered nature of living structures is very likely to keep breaking down over time If order breaks down the organism will no longer be alive So living creatures must keep repairing and maintaining their structures Since all these structures are made up of molecules they must move molecules around all
