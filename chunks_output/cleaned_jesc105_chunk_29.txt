56 Activity 56 Activity 56 n Observe fish in an aquarium They open and close their mouths and the gillslits or the operculum which covers the gillslits behind their eyes also open and close Are the timings of the opening and closing of the mouth and gillslits coordinated in some manner n Count the number of times the fish opens and closes its mouth in a minute n Compare this to the number of times you breathe in and out in a minute Since the amount of dissolved oxygen is fairly low compared to the amount of oxygen in the air the rate of breathing in aquatic organisms is much faster than that seen in terrestrial organisms Fishes take in water through their mouths and force it past the gills where the dissolved oxygen is taken up by blood Terrestrial organisms use the oxygen in the atmosphere for respiration This oxygen is absorbed by different organs in different animals All these organs have a structure that increases the surface area which is in contact with the oxygenrich atmosphere
