is the velocity of the object at a given instant the kinetic energy would be mv2 As the fall of the object continues the potential energy would decrease while the kinetic energy would increase When the object is about to reach the ground h 0 and v will be the highest Therefore the kinetic energy would be the largest and potential energy the least However the sum of the potential energy and kinetic energy of the object would be the same at all points That is potential energy kinetic energy constant or 1 constant 2 2 mgh mv 107 The sum of kinetic energy and potential energy of an object is its total mechanical energy We find that during the free fall of the object the decrease in potential energy at any point in its path appears as an equal amount of increase in kinetic energy Here the effect of air resistance on the motion of the object has been ignored There is thus a continual transformation of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy 202425 SCIENCE 122 A stronger person
