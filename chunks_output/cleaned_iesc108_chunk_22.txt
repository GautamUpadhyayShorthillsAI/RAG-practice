moving with uniform velocity u throughout the time t If u is zero then v will also be zero That is the object will remain at rest Exampl Exampl Exampl Exampl Exampleeeee 81 81 81 81 81 A constant force acts on an object of mass 5 kg for a duration of 2 s It increases the objects velocity from 3 m s1 to 7 m s1 Find the magnitude of the applied force Now if the force was applied for a duration of 5 s what would be the final velocity of the object Solution Solution Solution Solution Solution We have been given that u 3 m s1 and v 7 m s1 t 2 s and m 5 kg From Eq 85 we have F m v u t Substitution of values in this relation gives F 5 kg 7 m s1 3 m s12 s 10 N Now if this force is applied for a duration of 5 s t 5 s then the final velocity can be calculated by rewriting Eq 85 as Ft v u m On substituting the values of u F m and t we get the final velocity v 13 m s1 Fig 88 Fig 88 Fig 88 Fig 88 Fig 88 A fielder pulls his hands gradually with the moving ball while holding a catch 202425 SCIENCE
