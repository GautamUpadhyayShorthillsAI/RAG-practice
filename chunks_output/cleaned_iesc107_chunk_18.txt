Graphs provide a convenient method to present basic information about a variety of events For example in the telecast of a oneday cricket match vertical bar graphs show the run rate of a team in each over As you have studied in mathematics a straight line graph helps in solving a linear equation having two variables To describe the motion of an object we can use line graphs In this case line graphs show dependence of one physical quantity such as distance or velocity on another quantity such as time 741 DISTANCETIME GRAPHS The change in the position of an object with time can be represented on the distancetime graph adopting a convenient scale of choice In this graph time is taken along the xaxis and distance is taken along the yaxis Distancetime graphs can be employed under various conditions where objects move with uniform speed nonuniform speed remain at rest etc Fig 73 Fig 73 Fig 73 Fig 73 Fig 73 Distancetime graph of an object moving with uniform speed We know that when an object
