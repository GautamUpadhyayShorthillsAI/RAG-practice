of oscillation The frequency is expressed in hertz Hz Larger the amplitude of vibration the louder is the sound Higher the frequency of vibration the higher is the pitch and shriller is the sound Unpleasant sounds are called noise Excessive or unwanted sounds lead to noise pollution Noise pollution may pose health problems for human beings Attempts should be made to minimise noise pollution Plantation on the roadside and elsewhere can reduce noise pollution Exercises 1 Choose the correct answer Sound can travel through a gases only b solids only c liquids only d solids liquids and gases 2 Voice of which of the following is likely to have minimum frequency a Baby girl b Baby boy c A man d A woman 202425 SOUND 135 3 In the following statements tick T against those which are true and F against those which are false a Sound cannot travel in vacuum TF b The number of oscillations per second of a vibrating object is called its time period TF c If the amplitude of vibration is large sound is
