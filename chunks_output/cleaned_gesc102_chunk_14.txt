carbohydrates get broken into simple sugars such as glucose fats into fatty acids and glycerol and proteins into amino acids Absorption in the small intestine The digested food can now pass into the blood vessels in the wall of the intestine This process is called absorption The inner walls of the small intestine have thousands of fingerlike outgrowths These are called villi singular villus Can you guess what the role of villi could be in the intestine The villi increase the surface area for absorption of the digested food Each villus has a network of thin and small blood vessels close to its surface The surface of the villi absorbs the digested food materials The absorbed substances are transported via the blood vessels to different organs of the body where they are used to build complex substances such as the proteins required by the body This is called assimilation In the cells glucose breaks down with the help of oxygen into carbon dioxide and water and energy is released The food
