incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection This is one of the laws of reflection Let us perform another activity on reflection What would happen if I threw the light on the mirror along the normal Activity 132 Perform Activity 131 again This time use a sheet of stiff paper or a chart paper Let the sheet project a little beyond the edge of the Table Fig 134 Cut the projecting portion of the sheet in the middle Look at the reflected ray Make sure that the reflected ray extends to the projected portion of the paper Bend that part of the projected portion on which the reflected ray falls Can you still see the reflected ray Bring the paper back to the original Fig 132 Drawing the normal Fig 133 Angle of incidence and angle of reflection Reflected ray Normal Incident ray between the normal and incident ray is called the angle of incidence i The angle between the normal and the reflected ray is known as the angle of reflection r Fig 133 Measure the angle of incidence and the angle
