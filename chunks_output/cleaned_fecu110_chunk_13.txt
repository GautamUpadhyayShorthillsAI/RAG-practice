of bean seeds requires the right amount of water and air Why do seeds require these conditions for germination Do you think that the absence of one or more of these conditions will affect seed germination Let us understand how these conditions help in seed germination The effects of the following conditions have been seen in Activity 102 Water Seeds require water for germination Water enables the seeds to carry out the processes necessary for their growth The outer covering of the seed is called seed coat Water softens the seed coat and helps the tiny embryo inside it to develop into a plant Air and Soil Seeds need air for germination They use the air available in the spaces between soil particles Moreover spaces between the soil particles allow roots to grow easily Light andor dark conditions We have learnt that for the bean seeds presence of light is not essential for their germination In general most seeds do not require light for germination But after germination sunlight is
