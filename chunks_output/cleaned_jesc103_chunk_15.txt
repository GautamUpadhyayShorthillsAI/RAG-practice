with water is less violent The heat evolved is not sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire Cas 2H2Ol CaOH2aq H2g Calcium starts floating because the bubbles of hydrogen gas formed stick to the surface of the metal Magnesium does not react with cold water It reacts with hot water to form magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen It also starts floating due to the bubbles of hydrogen gas sticking to its surface Metals like aluminium iron and zinc do not react either with cold or hot water But they react with steam to form the metal oxide and hydrogen 2Als 3H2Og Al2O3s 3H2g 3Fes 4H2Og Fe3O4s 4H2g Metals such as lead copper silver and gold do not react with water at all 323 What happens when Metals react with Acids You have already learnt that metals react with acids to give a salt and hydrogen gas Figure 33 Figure 33 Figure 33 Figure 33 Figure 33 Action of steam on a metal 202425 Science 44 Metal Dilute acid Salt Hydrogen But do all metals react in the same manner Let us find out Activity 311
