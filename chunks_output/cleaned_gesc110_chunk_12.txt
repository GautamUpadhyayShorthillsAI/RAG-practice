Another reason for excessive current can be the connection of many devices to a single socket This may cause overload in the circuit You might have read reports in newspapers about fires caused by short circuits and overloads buildings fuses are inserted in all electrical circuits There is a maximum limit on the current which can safely flow through a circuit If by accident the current exceeds this safe limit the wires an electric bulb gets heated to such a high temperature that it starts glowing If a large current passes through a wire the wire may become so hot that it may even melt and break But is it possible for a wire to melt and break Let us check it out Activity 104 Make the circuit we used for Activity 103 again However replace the cell with a battery of four cells Also in place of the nichrome wire tie a thin strand of steel wool The steel wool is commonly used for cleaning utensils and is available in grocery shops If there are any fans in the room switch them off Now pass
