the block Also calculate the magnitude of the force exerted by the wooden block on the bullet 14 An object of mass 1 kg travelling in a straight line with a velocity of 10 m s1 collides with and sticks to a stationary wooden block of mass 5 kg Then they both move off together in the same straight line Calculate the total momentum just before the impact and just after the impact Also calculate the velocity of the combined object 15 An object of mass 100 kg is accelerated uniformly from a velocity of 5 m s1 to 8 m s1 in 6 s Calculate the initial and final momentum of the object Also find the magnitude of the force exerted on the object 16 Akhtar Kiran and Rahul were riding in a motorcar that was moving with a high velocity on an expressway when an insect hit the windshield and got stuck on the windscreen Akhtar and Kiran started pondering over the situation Kiran suggested that the insect suffered a greater change in momentum as compared to the change in momentum of the motorcar because
