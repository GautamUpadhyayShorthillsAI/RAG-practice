simultaneously from the first floor of a building Observe whether both of them reach the ground simultaneously We see that paper reaches the ground little later than the stone This happens because of air resistance The air offers resistance due to friction to the motion of the falling objects The resistance offered by air to the paper is more than the resistance offered to the stone If we do the experiment in a glass jar from which air has been sucked out the paper and the stone would fall at the same rate change in the velocity of falling objects While falling there is no change in the direction of motion of the objects But due to the earths attraction there will be a change in the magnitude of the velocity Any change in velocity involves acceleration Whenever an object falls towards the earth an acceleration is involved This acceleration is due to the earths gravitational force Therefore this acceleration is called the acceleration due to the gravitational force of the earth or
