chemical properties of CH3OH C2H5OH C3H7OH and C4H9OH are all very similar Hence such a series of compounds in which the same functional group substitutes for hydrogen in a carbon chain is called a homologous series Let us look at the homologous series that we saw earlier in Table 42 If we look at the formulae of successive compounds say CH4 and C2H6 these differ by a CH2 unit C2H6 and C3H8 these differ by a CH2 unit What is the difference between the next pair propane and butane C4H10 Can you find out the difference in molecular masses between these pairs the atomic mass of carbon is 12 u and the atomic mass of hydrogen is 1 u Similarly take the homologous series for alkenes The first member of the series is ethene which we have already come across in Section 421 What is the formula for ethene The succeeding members have the formula C3H6 C4H8 and C5H10 Do these also differ by a CH2 Table 43 Some functional groups in carbon compounds Hetero Hetero Hetero Hetero Hetero Class of Class
