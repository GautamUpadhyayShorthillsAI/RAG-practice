the plasma membrane The plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose Cellulose is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plants When a living plant cell loses water through osmosis there is shrinkage or contraction of the contents of the cell away from the cell wall This phenomenon is known as plasmolysis We can observe this phenomenon by performing the following activity Activity 56 Mount the peel of a Rhoeo leaf in water on a slide and examine cells under the high power of a microscope Note the small green granules called chloroplasts They contain a green substance called chlorophyll Put a strong solution of sugar or salt on the mounted leaf on the slide Wait for a minute and observe under a microscope What do we see Now place some Rhoeo leaves in boiling water for a few minutes This kills the cells Then mount one leaf on a slide and observe it under a microscope Put a strong solution of sugar or salt on the mounted leaf on the slide Wait for a minute and observe
