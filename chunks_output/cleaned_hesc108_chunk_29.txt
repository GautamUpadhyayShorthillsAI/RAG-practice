plane surface Does it stick to the surface Now try to pull it off the surface Can you do it 202425 FORCE AND PRESSURE 107 If the area of my head were 15 cm 15 cm how much force air will exert on my head Fig 819 Pressure of atmosphere on your head surface if there were no air at all between the sucker and the surface Does it give you an idea how large the atmospheric pressure is The force due to air in a column of the height of the atmosphere and area 15 cm 15 cm Fig 819 is nearly equal to the force of gravity on an object of mass 225 kg 2250N The reason we are not crushed under this force of gravity is that the pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric pressure and balances the pressure from outside Did you know Otto von Guericke a German scientist of the 17th century invented a pump to extract air out of a vessel With the help of this pump he demonstrated dramatically the force of the air pressure He joined two hollow metallic hemispheres of 51 cm diameter each and
