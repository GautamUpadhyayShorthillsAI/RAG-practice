comes from studying static electricity and the condition under which electricity is conducted by different substances 41 Charged Particles in Matter For understanding the nature of charged particles in matter let us carry out the following activities Activity 41 A Comb dry hair Does the comb then attract small pieces of paper B Rub a glass rod with a silk cloth and bring the rod near an inflated balloon Observe what happens From these activities can we conclude that on rubbing two objects together they become electrically charged Where does this charge come from This question can be answered by knowing that an atom is divisible and consists of charged particles Many scientists contributed in revealing the presence of charged particles in an atom It was known by 1900 that the atom was indivisible particle but contained at least one subatomic particle the electron identified by JJ Thomson Even before the electron was identified E Goldstein in 1886 discovered the presence of new
