size they do not scatter a beam of light passing through the solution So the path of light is not visible in a solution The solute particles cannot be separated from the mixture by the process of filtration The solute particles do not settle down when left undisturbed that is a solution is stable 221 CONCENTRATION OF A SOLUTION In activity 22 we observed that groups A and B obtained different shades of solutions So we understand that in a solution the relative proportion of the solute and solvent can be varied Depending upon the amount of solute present in a solution it can be called dilute concentrated or saturated solution Dilute and concentrated are comparative terms In activity 22 the solution obtained by group A is dilute as compared to that obtained by group B Activity 23 Take approximately 50 mL of water each in two separate beakers Add salt in one beaker and sugar or barium chloride in the second beaker with continuous stirring When no more solute can be dissolved heat the
