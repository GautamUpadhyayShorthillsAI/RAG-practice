of one carbon atom then we would assign carbon an atomic mass of 10 u and oxygen an atomic mass of 133 u However it is more convenient to have these numbers as Table 31 Symbols for some elements Element Symbol Element Symbol Element Symbol Aluminium Al Copper Cu Nitrogen N Argon Ar Fluorine F Oxygen O Barium Ba Gold Au Potassium K Boron B Hydrogen H Silicon Si Bromine Br Iodine I Silver Ag Calcium Ca Iron Fe Sodium Na Carbon C Lead Pb Sulphur S Chlorine Cl Magnesium Mg Uranium U Cobalt Co Neon Ne Zinc Zn 202425 SCIENCE 30 whole numbers or as near to a whole numbers as possible While searching for various atomic mass units scientists initially took 1 16 of the mass of an atom of naturally occurring oxygen as the unit This was considered relevant due to two reasons oxygen reacted with a large number of elements and formed compounds this atomic mass unit gave masses of most of the elements as whole numbers However in 1961 for a universally accepted atomic mass unit carbon12 isotope was
