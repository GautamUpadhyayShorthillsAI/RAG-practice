of tiny particles in just one crystal of potassium permanganate which keep on dividing themselves into smaller and smaller particles The same activity can be done using 2 mL of Dettol instead of potassium permanganate The smell can be detected even on repeated dilution The particles of matter are very small they are small beyond our imagination 12 Characteristics of Particles of Matter 121 PARTICLES OF MATTER HAVE SPACE BETWEEN THEM In activities 11 and 12 we saw that particles of sugar salt Dettol or potassium permanganate got evenly distributed in water Similarly when we make tea coffee or lemonade nimbu paani particles of one type of matter get into the spaces between particles of the other This shows that there is enough space between particles of matter 202425 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 3 If we consider each student as a particle of matter then in which group the particles held each other with the maximum force Activity 17 Take an iron nail a piece of chalk and a rubber band Try
