relative size and approximate position of the image n Move the candle away from the lens Note the change in the size of the image What happens to the size of the image when the candle is placed too far away from the lens What conclusion can you draw from this Activity A concave lens will always give a virtual erect and diminished image irrespective of the position of the object 935 Image Formation in Lenses Using Ray Diagrams We can represent image formation by lenses using ray diagrams Ray diagrams will also help us to study the nature position and relative size of the image formed by lenses For drawing ray diagrams in lenses alike of spherical mirrors we consider any two of the following rays i A ray of light from the object parallel to the principal axis after refraction from a convex lens passes through the principal focus on the other side of the lens as shown in Fig 913 a In case of a concave lens the ray appears to diverge from the principal focus located on the same side of
