sections that all metals are not equally reactive We checked the reactivity of various metals with oxygen water and acids But all metals do not react with these reagents So we were not able to put all the metal samples we had collected in decreasing order of their reactivity Displacement reactions studied in Chapter 1 give better evidence about the reactivity of metals It is simple and easy if metal A displaces metal B from its solution it is more reactive than B Metal A Salt solution of B Salt solution of A Metal B Which metal copper or iron is more reactive according to your observations in Activity 312 325 The Reactivity Series The reactivity series is a list of metals arranged in the order of their decreasing activities After performing displacement experiments Activities 19 and 312 the following series Table 32 known as the reactivity or activity series has been developed Table 32 Activity series Relative reactivities of metals K Potassium Most reactive Na Sodium Ca Calcium Mg
