be its electronic configuration and its valency Chlorine forms a diatomic molecule Cl2 Can you draw the electron dot structure for this molecule Note that only the valence shell electrons need to be depicted In the case of oxygen we see the formation of a double bond between two oxygen atoms This is because an atom of oxygen has six electrons in its L shell the atomic number of oxygen is eight and it requires two more electrons to complete its octet So each atom of oxygen shares two electrons with another atom of oxygen to give us the structure shown in Fig 43 The two electrons contributed by each oxygen atom give rise to two shared pairs of electrons This is said to constitute a double bond between the two atoms Can you now depict a molecule of water showing the nature of bonding between one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms Does the molecule have single bonds or double bonds What would happen in the case of a diatomic molecule of nitrogen Nitrogen has the atomic number 7 What would
