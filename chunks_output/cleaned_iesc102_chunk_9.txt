in the second beaker with continuous stirring When no more solute can be dissolved heat the contents of the beaker to raise the temperature by about 5oC Start adding the solute again Is the amount of salt and sugar or barium chloride that can be dissolved in water at a given temperature the same At any particular temperature a solution that has dissolved as much solute as it is capable of dissolving is said to be a saturated solution In other words when no more solute can be dissolved in a solution at a given temperature it is called a saturated solution The amount of the solute present in the saturated solution at this temperature is called its solubility If the amount of solute contained in a solution is less than the saturation level it is called an unsaturated solution What would happen if you were to take a saturated solution at a certain temperature and cool it slowly We can infer from the above activity that different substances in a given solvent have different solubilities at
