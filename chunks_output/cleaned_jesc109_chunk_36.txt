of light in medium 1 and v2 be the speed of light in medium 2 The refractive index of medium 2 with respect to medium 1 is given by the ratio of the speed of light in medium 1 and the speed of light in medium 2 This is usually represented by the symbol n21 This can be expressed in an equation form as n21 Speed of light in medium 1 Speed of light in medium 2 v v 1 2 95 By the same argument the refractive index of medium 1 with respect to medium 2 is represented as n12 It is given by n12 Speed of light in medium 2 Speed of light in medium 1 v v 2 1 96 If medium 1 is vacuum or air then the refractive index of medium 2 is considered with respect to vacuum This is called the absolute refractive index of the medium It is simply represented as n2 If c is the speed of Figure 911 Figure 911 Figure 911 Figure 911 Figure 911 202425 Light Reflection and Refraction 149 The ability of a medium to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density Optical density has a definite
