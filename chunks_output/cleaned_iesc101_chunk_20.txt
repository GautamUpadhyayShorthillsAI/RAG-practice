gas The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is known as its boiling point Boiling is a bulk phenomenon Particles from the bulk of the liquid gain enough energy to change into the vapour state For water this temperature is 373 K 100oC 273 100 373 K Can you define the latent heat of vaporisation Do it in the same way as we have defined the latent heat of fusion Particles in steam that is water vapour at 373 K 1000 C have more energy than water at the same temperature This is because particles in steam have absorbed extra energy in the form of latent heat of vaporisation Note Kelvin is the SI unit of temperature 0o C 27315 K For convenience we take 0o C 273 K after rounding off the decimal To change a temperature on the Kelvin scale to the Celsius scale you have to subtract 273 from the given temperature and to convert a temperature on the Celsius scale to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature So we infer that the state of
