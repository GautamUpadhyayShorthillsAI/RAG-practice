all the properties of that substance Atoms of the same element or of different elements can join together to form molecules Q 202425 ATOMS AND MOLECULES 31 331 MOLECULES OF ELEMENTS The molecules of an element are constituted by the same type of atoms Molecules of many elements such as argon Ar helium He etc are made up of only one atom of that element But this is not the case with most of the non metals For example a molecule of oxygen consists of two atoms of oxygen and hence it is known as a diatomic molecule O2 If 3 atoms of oxygen unite into a molecule instead of the usual 2 we get ozone O3 The number of atoms constituting a molecule is known as its atomicity Metals and some other elements such as carbon do not have a simple structure but consist of a very large and indefinite number of atoms bonded together Let us look at the atomicity of some nonmetals Table 33 Atomicity of some elements Type of Name Atomicity Element NonMetal Argon Monoatomic Helium Monoatomic Oxygen Diatomic
