n Repeat the above procedure and draw as many lines as you can You will get a pattern shown in Fig 124 These lines represent the magnetic field around the magnet These are known as magnetic field lines n Observe the deflection in the compass needle as you move it along a field line The deflection increases as the needle is moved towards the poles Figure 124 Figure 124 Figure 124 Figure 124 Figure 124 Field lines around a bar magnet 202425 Science 198 1221 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Straight Conductor What determines the pattern of the magnetic field generated by a current through a conductor Does the pattern depend on the shape of the conductor We shall investigate this with an activity We shall first consider the pattern of the magnetic field around a straight conductor carrying current Activity 124 Activity 124 Activity 124 Activity 124 Activity 124 n Take a long straight copper wire two or three cells of 15 V each and a plug key Connect all of them in series as shown
