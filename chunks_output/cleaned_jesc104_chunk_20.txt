structure Benzene C6H6 Figure 410 Figure 410 Figure 410 Figure 410 Figure 410 Structure of benzene All these carbon compounds which contain only carbon and hydrogen are called hydrocarbons Among these the saturated hydrocarbons are called alkanes The unsaturated hydrocarbons which contain one or more double bonds are called alkenes Those containing one or more triple bonds are called alkynes 423 Will you be my Friend Carbon seems to be a very friendly element So far we have been looking at compounds containing carbon and hydrogen only But carbon also forms 202425 Science 66 bonds with other elements such as halogens oxygen nitrogen and sulphur In a hydrocarbon chain one or more hydrogens can be replaced by these elements such that the valency of carbon remains satisfied In such compounds the element replacing hydrogen is referred to as a heteroatom These heteroatoms are also present in some groups as given in Table 43 These heteroatoms and the group containing these confer specific
