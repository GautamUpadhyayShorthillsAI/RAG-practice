sustain the uniform motion of the marble In practical situations it is difficult to achieve a zero unbalanced force This is because of the presence of the frictional force acting opposite to the direction of motion Thus in practice the marble stops after travelling some distance The effect of the frictional force may be minimised by using a smooth marble and a smooth plane and providing a lubricant on top of the planes Fig 85 a the downward motion b the upward motion of a marble on an inclined plane and c on a double inclined plane Newton further studied Galileos ideas on force and motion and presented three fundamental laws that govern the motion of objects These three laws are known as Newtons laws of motion The first law of motion is stated as An object remains in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless compelled to change that state by an applied force In other words all objects resist a change in their state of motion In a qualitative way the tendency of
