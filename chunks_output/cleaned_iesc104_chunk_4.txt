Now the big question was what sort of structure did these particles of the atom form We will find the answer to this question below 4 SSSSSTRUCTURE TRUCTURE TRUCTURE TRUCTURE TRUCTURE OF OF OF OF OF THE THE THE THE THE A A A A ATOM TOM TOM TOM TOM C hapter 202425 uestions 1 What are canal rays 2 If an atom contains one electron and one proton will it carry any charge or not 42 The Structure of an Atom We have learnt Daltons atomic theory in Chapter 3 which suggested that the atom was indivisible and indestructible But the discovery of two fundamental particles electrons and protons inside the atom led to the failure of this aspect of Daltons atomic theory It was then considered necessary to know how electrons and protons are arranged within an atom For explaining this many scientists proposed various atomic models JJ Thomson was the first one to propose a model for the structure of an atom 421 THOMSONS MODEL OF AN ATOM Thomson proposed the model of an atom to be similar to that of a
