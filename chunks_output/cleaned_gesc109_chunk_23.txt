the maximum part of the paper on which the graph is to be drawn Suppose that you are given a graph paper of size 25 cm 25 cm One of the scales which meets the above conditions and can accommodate the data of Table 95 could be Distance 5 km 1 cm and Time 6 min 1 cm Can you now draw the distancetime graph for the motion of the bus Is the graph drawn by you similar to that shown in Fig 913 Distancetime graphs provide a variety of information about the motion Fig 914 Distancetime graph of the bus Y X Reprint 202425 SCIENCE 104 when compared to the data presented by a table For example Table 95 gives information about the distance moved by the bus only at some definite time intervals On the other hand from the distancetime graph we can find the distance moved by the bus at any instant of time Suppose we want to know how much distance the bus had travelled at 815 AM We mark the point corresponding to the time 815 AM on the xaxis Fig 914 Suppose this point is A Next we draw a line
