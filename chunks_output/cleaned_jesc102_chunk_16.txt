KOHs K aqOH aq H O 2 MgOH2s H O 2 Mg2aq2OHaq Bases generate hydroxide OH ions in water Bases which are soluble in water are called alkalis Do You Know All bases do not dissolve in water An alkali is a base that dissolves in water They are soapy to touch bitter and corrosive Never taste or touch them as they may cause harm Which of the bases in the Table 21 are alkalis Now as we have identified that all acids generate Haq and all bases generate OH aq we can view the neutralisation reaction as follows Acid Base Salt Water H X M OH MX HOH Haq OH aq H2Ol Let us see what is involved when water is mixed with an acid or a base Activity 210 Activity 210 Activity 210 Activity 210 Activity 210 n Take 10 mL water in a beaker n Add a few drops of concentrated H2SO4 to it and swirl the beaker slowly n Touch the base of the beaker n Is there a change in temperature n Is this an exothermic or endothermic process n Repeat the above Activity with sodium hydroxide pellets and record your observations
