that inside the cell As soon as there is a difference of concentration of CO2 inside and outside a cell CO2 moves out of the cell from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration outside the cell by the process of diffusion Similarly O2 enters the cell by the process of diffusion when the level or concentration of O2 inside the cell decreases Thus diffusion plays an important role in gaseous exchange between the cells as well as the cell and its external environment Water also obeys the law of diffusion The movement of water molecules through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis Q 202425 SCIENCE 52 The movement of water across the plasma membrane is also affected by the amount of substance dissolved in water Thus osmosis is the net diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane toward a higher solute concentration What will happen if we put an animal cell or a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt in water One of the following
