Dilute acid Salt Hydrogen But do all metals react in the same manner Let us find out Activity 311 Activity 311 Activity 311 Activity 311 Activity 311 n Collect all the metal samples except sodium and potassium again If the samples are tarnished rub them clean with sand paper CAUTION Do not take sodium and potassium as they react vigorously even with cold water n Put the samples separately in test tubes containing dilute hydrochloric acid n Suspend thermometers in the test tubes so that their bulbs are dipped in the acid n Observe the rate of formation of bubbles carefully n Which metals reacted vigorously with dilute hydrochloric acid n With which metal did you record the highest temperature n Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with dilute acids Write equations for the reactions of magnesium aluminium zinc and iron with dilute hydrochloric acid Hydrogen gas is not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid It is because HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent It
