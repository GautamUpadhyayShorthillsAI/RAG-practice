by diffusion The purified blood is pumped back into the patient This is similar to the function of the kidney but it is different since there is no re absorption involved Normally in a healthy adult the initial filtrate in the kidneys is about 180 L daily However the volume actually excreted is only a litre or two a day because the remaining filtrate is re absorbed in the kidney tubules Figure 514 Figure 514 Figure 514 Figure 514 Figure 514 Structure of a nephron 202425 Science 98 552 Excretion in Plants Plants use completely different strategies for excretion than those of animals Oxygen itself can be thought of as a waste product generated during photosynthesis We have discussed earlier how plants deal with oxygen as well as CO2 They can get rid of excess water by transpiration For other wastes plants use the fact that many of their tissues consist of dead cells and that they can even lose some parts such as leaves Many plant waste products are stored in cellular vacuoles Waste
