of a body moving with a certain velocity is equal to the work done on it to make it acquire that velocity 1022 KINETIC ENERGY Activity 106 Take a heavy ball Drop it on a thick bed of sand A wet bed of sand would be better Drop the ball on the sand bed from height of about 25 cm The ball creates a depression Repeat this activity from heights of 50 cm 1m and 15 m Ensure that all the depressions are distinctly visible Mark the depressions to indicate the height from which the ball was dropped Compare their depths Which one of them is deepest Which one is shallowest Why What has caused the ball to make a deeper dent Discuss and analyse Activity 107 Set up the apparatus as shown in Fig 105 Place a wooden block of known mass in front of the trolley at a convenient fixed distance Place a known mass on the pan so that the trolley starts moving James Prescott Joule was an o u t s t a n d i n g British physicist He is best known for his research in electricity and thermodynamics Amongst other
