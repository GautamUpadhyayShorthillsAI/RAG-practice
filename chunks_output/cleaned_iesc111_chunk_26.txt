blocks which are invisible from outside reduces the strength of the structure Ultrasonic waves are allowed to pass through the metal block and detectors are used to detect the transmitted waves If there is even a small defect the ultrasound gets reflected back indicating the presence of the flaw or defect as shown in Fig 1114 Q Metallic components are generally used uestions 1 What is the audible range of the average human ear 2 What is the range of frequencies associated with a Infrasound b Ultrasound 115 Applications of Ultrasound Ultrasounds are high frequency waves Ultrasounds are able to travel along well defined paths even in the presence of obstacles Ultrasounds are used extensively in industries and for medical purposes Ultrasound is generally used to clean parts located in hardtoreach places for example spiral tube odd shaped parts electronic components etc Objects to be cleaned are placed in a cleaning solution and ultrasonic waves are sent into the solution Due to the high
