depend on the body design of the organisms 721 Fission For unicellular organisms cell division or fission leads to the creation of new individuals Many different patterns of fission have been observed Many bacteria and protozoa simply split into two equal halves during cell division In organisms such as Amoeba the splitting of the two cells during division can take place in any plane Activity 73 Activity 73 Activity 73 Activity 73 Activity 73 n Observe a permanent slide of Amoeba under a microscope n Similarly observe another permanent slide of Amoeba showing binary fission n Now compare the observations of both the slides However some unicellular organisms show somewhat more organisation of their bodies such as is seen in Leishmania which cause kalaazar which have a whiplike structure at one end of the cell In such organisms binary fission occurs in a definite orientation in relation to Figure 71b Figure 71b Figure 71b Figure 71b Figure 71b Binary fission in Leishmania a b c d e f
