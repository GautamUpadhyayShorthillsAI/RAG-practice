are the products of photosynthesis Solar energy is absorbed by the chlorophylls present in leavesplants Oxygen is produced during photosynthesis Oxygen released in photosynthesis is utilised by living organisms for their survival Many fungi derive nutrition from dead and decaying matter They are saprotrophs A few plants and all animals are dependent on others for their nutrition and are called heterotrophs plants are grown Most of the pulses dals are obtained from leguminous plants In this chapter you learnt that most of the plants are autotrophs Only a few plants are parasitic or saprotrophic They derive nutrition from other organisms All animals are categorised as heterotrophs since they depend on plants and other animals for food Can we say that the insectivorous plants are partial heterotrophs Keywords Autotrophic Chlorophyll Heterotrophs Host Insectivorous Nutrient Nutrition Parasite Photosynthesis Saprotrophs Saprotrophic Stomata Reprint 202425 NUTRITION IN PLANTS 9 Exercise 1
