earths crust is the major source of metals Seawater also contains some soluble salts such as sodium chloride magnesium chloride etc The elements or compounds which occur naturally in the earths crust are known as minerals At some places minerals contain a very high percentage of a particular metal and the metal can be profitably extracted from it These minerals are called ores 341 Extraction of Metals You have learnt about the reactivity series of metals Having this knowledge you can easily understand how a metal is extracted from its ore Some metals are found in the earths crust in the free state Some are found in the form of their compounds The metals at the bottom of the activity series are the least reactive They are often found in a free 202425 Science 50 state For example gold silver platinum and copper are found in the free state Copper and silver are also found in the combined state as their sulphide or oxide ores The metals at the top of the activity series K Na Ca Mg and Al
