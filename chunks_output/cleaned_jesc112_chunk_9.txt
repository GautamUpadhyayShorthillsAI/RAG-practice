copper wire two or three cells of 15 V each and a plug key Connect all of them in series as shown in Fig 125 a n Place the straight wire parallel to and over a compass needle n Plug the key in the circuit n Observe the direction of deflection of the north pole of the needle If the current flows from north to south as shown in Fig 125 a the north pole of the compass needle would move towards the east n Replace the cell connections in the circuit as shown in Fig 125 b This would result in the change of the direction of current through the copper wire that is from south to north n Observe the change in the direction of deflection of the needle You will see that now the needle moves in opposite direction that is towards the west Fig 125 b It means that the direction of magnetic field produced by the electric current is also reversed Figure 125 Figure 125 Figure 125 Figure 125 Figure 125 A simple electric circuit in which a straight copper wire is placed parallel to and over a compass
