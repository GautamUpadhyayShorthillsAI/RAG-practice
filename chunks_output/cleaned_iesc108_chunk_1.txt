In the previous chapter we described the motion of an object along a straight line in terms of its position velocity and acceleration We saw that such a motion can be uniform or nonuniform We have not yet discovered what causes the motion Why does the speed of an object change with time Do all motions require a cause If so what is the nature of this cause In this chapter we shall make an attempt to quench all such curiosities For many centuries the problem of motion and its causes had puzzled scientists and philosophers A ball on the ground when given a small hit does not move forever Such observations suggest that rest is the natural state of an object This remained the belief until Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton developed an entirely different approach to understand motion In our everyday life we observe that some effort is required to put a stationary object into motion or to stop a moving object We ordinarily experience this as a muscular effort and say that we must push or hit
