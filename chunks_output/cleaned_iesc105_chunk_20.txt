prokaryotes Pro primitive or primary karyote karyon nucleus Organisms with cells having a nuclear membrane are called eukaryotes Prokaryotic cells see Fig 54 also lack most of the other cytoplasmic organelles present in eukaryotic cells Many of the functions of such organelles are also performed by poorly organised parts of the cytoplasm see section 524 The chlorophyll in photosynthetic prokaryotic bacteria is associated with membranous vesicles bag like structures but not with plastids as in eukaryotic cells see section 525 Ribosomes Plasma membrane Cell wall Nucleoid Fig 54 Prokaryotic cell 524 CYTOPLASM When we look at the temporary mounts of onion peel as well as human cheek cells we can see a large region of each cell enclosed by the cell membrane This region takes up very little stain It is called the cytoplasm The cytoplasm is the fluid content inside the plasma membrane It also contains many specialised cell organelles Each of these organelles performs a specific function for
