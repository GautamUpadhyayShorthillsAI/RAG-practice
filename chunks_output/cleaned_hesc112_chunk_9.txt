is that the foil strips lose charge to the earth through your body We say that the foil strips are discharged The process of transferring of charge from a charged object to the earth is called earthing Earthing is provided in buildings to protect us from electrical shocks due to any leakage of electrical current 125 The Story of Lightning It is now possible to explain lightning in terms of the charges produced by rubbing During the development of a thunderstorm the air currents move upward while the water droplets move downward These vigorous movements cause separation of charges By a process not yet completely understood the positive charges collect near the upper edges of the clouds and the negative charges accumulate near the lower edges There is accumulation of positive charges near the ground also When the magnitude of the accumulated charges becomes very large the air which is normally a poor conductor of electricity is no longer able to resist their flow Negative and positive
