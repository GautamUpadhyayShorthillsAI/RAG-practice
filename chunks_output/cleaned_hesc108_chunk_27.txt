you inflate a balloon why do you have to close its mouth What happens when you open the mouth of an inflated balloon Suppose you have a balloon which has holes Would you 202425 SCIENCE 106 Unit area Fig 817 Atmospheric pressure is the force of gravity on air in a column of unit area be able to inflate it If not why Can we say that air exerts pressure in all directions Do you recall what happens to the air in the bicycle tube when it has a puncture Do these observations suggest that air exerts pressure on the inner walls of an inflated balloon or a tube So we find that gases too exert pressure on the walls of their container 810 Atmospheric Pressure You know that there is air all around us This envelop of air is known as the atmosphere The atmospheric air extends up to many kilometres above the surface of the earth The pressure exerted by this air is known as atmospheric pressure We know that pressure is force per unit area If we imagine a unit area and a very long cylinder standing on
