solenoid behaves as a magnetic north pole while the other behaves as the south pole The field lines inside the solenoid are in the form of parallel straight lines This indicates that the magnetic field is the same at all points inside the solenoid That is the field is uniform inside the solenoid A strong magnetic field produced inside a solenoid can be used to magnetise a piece of magnetic material like soft iron when placed inside the coil Fig 1211 The magnet so formed is called an electromagnet Figure 1210 Figure 1210 Figure 1210 Figure 1210 Figure 1210 Field lines of the magnetic field through and around a current carrying solenoid Figure 1211 Figure 1211 Figure 1211 Figure 1211 Figure 1211 A currentcarrying solenoid coil is used to magnetise steel rod inside it an electromagnet Q U E S T I O N S 1 Consider a circular loop of wire lying in the plane of the table Let the current pass through the loop clockwise Apply the righthand rule to find out the direction of the magnetic field
