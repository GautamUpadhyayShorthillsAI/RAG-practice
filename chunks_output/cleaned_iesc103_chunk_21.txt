NaCl iron sulphide FeS copper oxide CuO etc where oxygen chlorine sulphur are non metals and are written on the right whereas calcium sodium iron and copper are metals and are written on the left in compounds formed with polyatomic ions the number of ions present in the compound is indicated by enclosing the formula of ion in a bracket and writing the number of ions outside the bracket For example Mg OH2 In case the number of polyatomic ion is one the bracket is not required For example NaOH 341 FORMULAE OF SIMPLE COMPOUNDS The simplest compounds which are made up of two different elements are called binary compounds Valencies of some ions are given in Table 36 You can use these to write formulae for compounds While writing the chemical formulae for compounds we write the constituent elements and their valencies as shown below Then we must crossover the valencies of the combining atoms Examples 1 Formula of hydrogen chloride Formula of the compound would be HCl 2 Formula of hydrogen
