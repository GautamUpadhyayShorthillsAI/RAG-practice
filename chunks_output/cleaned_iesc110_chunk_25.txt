1013 and 1014 we learnt that the form of energy can be changed from one form to another What happens to the total energy of a system during or after the process Whenever energy gets transformed the total energy remains unchanged This is the law of conservation of energy According to this law energy can only be converted from one form to another it can neither be created or destroyed The total energy before and after the transformation remains the same The law of conservation of energy is valid in all situations and for all kinds of transformations Consider a simple example Let an object of mass m be made to fall freely from a height h At the start the potential energy is mgh and kinetic energy is zero Why is the kinetic energy zero It is zero because its velocity is zero The total energy of the object is thus mgh As it falls its potential energy will change into kinetic energy If v is the velocity of the object at a given instant the kinetic energy would be mv2 As the fall of the
