rules are followed for writing the number of electrons in different energy levels or shells i The maximum number of electrons present in a shell is given by the Neils Bohr 18851962 was born in Copenhagen on 7 October 1885 He was appointed professor of physics at Copenhagen University in 1916 He got the Nobel prize for his work on the structure of atom in 1922 Among Professor Bohrs numerous writings three appearing as books are i The Theory of Spectra and Atomic Constitution ii Atomic Theory and iii The Description of Nature These orbits or shells are called energy levels Energy levels in an atom are shown in Fig 43 Q Fig 43 A few energy levels in an atom These orbits or shells are represented by the letters KLMN or the numbers n1234 Q 202425 SCIENCE 42 formula 2n2 where n is the orbit number or energy level index 123 Hence the maximum number of electrons in different shells are as follows first orbit or Kshell will be 2 12 2 second orbit or Lshell will be 2 22 8 third orbit or Mshell
