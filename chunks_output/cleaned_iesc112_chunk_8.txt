Quality considerations of crop products vary from crop to crop Baking quality is important in wheat protein quality in pulses oil quality in oilseeds and preserving quality in fruits and vegetables Biotic and abiotic resistance Crops production can go down due to biotic diseases insects and nematodes and abiotic drought salinity water logging heat cold and frost stresses under different situations Varieties resistant to these stresses can improve crop production Change in maturity duration The shorter the duration of the crop from sowing to harvesting the more economical is the variety Such short durations allow farmers to grow multiple rounds of crops in a year Short duration also reduces the cost of crop production Uniform maturity makes the harvesting process easy and reduces losses during harvesting Wider adaptability Developing varieties for wider adaptability will help in stabilising the crop production under different environmental conditions One variety can then be grown under
