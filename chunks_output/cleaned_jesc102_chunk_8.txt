your observations The reaction that takes place can be written as follows 2NaOHaq Zns Na2ZnO2s H2g Sodium zincate You find again that hydrogen is formed in the reaction However such reactions are not possible with all metals 213 How do Metal Carbonates and Metal Hydrogencarbonates React with Acids Activity 25 Activity 25 Activity 25 Activity 25 Activity 25 n Take two test tubes label them as A and B n Take about 05 g of sodium carbonate Na2CO3 in test tube A and about 05 g of sodium hydrogencarbonate NaHCO3 in test tube B n Add about 2 mL of dilute HCl to both the test tubes n What do you observe n Pass the gas produced in each case through lime water calcium hydroxide solution as shown in Fig 22 and record your observations Figure 22 Figure 22 Figure 22 Figure 22 Figure 22 Passing carbon dioxide gas through calcium hydroxide solution 202425 Acids Bases and Salts 21 Activity 26 Activity 26 Activity 26 Activity 26 Activity 26 n Take about 2 mL of dilute NaOH solution in a test tube and
