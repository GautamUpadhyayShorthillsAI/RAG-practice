copper sulphate solution n Compare the intensity of the blue colour of copper sulphate solutions in test tubes A and B Fig 18 b n Also compare the colour of the iron nails dipped in the copper sulphate solution with the one kept aside Fig 18 b Take about 2 g barium hydroxide in a test tube Add 1 g of ammonium chloride and mix with the help of a glass rod Touch the bottom of the test tube with your palm What do you feel Is this an exothermic or endothermic reaction Carry out the following Activity Silver bromide also behaves in the same way 2AgBrs Sunlight 2Ags Br2g 123 The above reactions are used in black and white photography What form of energy is causing these decomposition reactions We have seen that the decomposition reactions require energy either in the form of heat light or electricity for breaking down the reactants Reactions in which energy is absorbed are known as endothermic reactions 202425 Chemical Reactions and Equations 11 Why does the iron nail become brownish in
