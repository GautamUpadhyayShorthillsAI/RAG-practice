of this force the stone flies off along a straight line This straight line will be a tangent to the circular path More to know Tangent to a circle A straight line that meets the circle at one and only one point is called a tangent to the circle Straight line ABC is a tangent to the circle at point B The motion of the moon around the earth is due to the centripetal force The centripetal force is provided by the force of attraction of the earth If there were no such force the moon would pursue a uniform straight line motion It is seen that a falling apple is attracted towards the earth Does the apple attract the earth If so we do not see the earth moving towards an apple Why According to the third law of motion the apple does attract the earth But according to the second law of motion for a given force acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass of an object Eq 84 The mass of an apple is negligibly small compared to that of the earth So we do not see the earth moving towards the
