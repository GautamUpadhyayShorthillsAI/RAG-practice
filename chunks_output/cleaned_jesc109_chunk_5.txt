Compare the characteristics of the image on the two surfaces The curved surface of a shining spoon could be considered as a curved mirror The most commonly used type of curved mirror is the spherical mirror The reflecting surface of such mirrors can be considered to form a part of the surface of a sphere Such mirrors whose reflecting surfaces are spherical are called spherical mirrors We shall now study about spherical mirrors in some detail 92 SPHERIC 92 SPHERIC 92 SPHERIC 92 SPHERIC 92 SPHERICAL MIRRORS AL MIRRORS AL MIRRORS AL MIRRORS AL MIRRORS The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror may be curved inwards or outwards A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved inwards that is faces towards the centre of the sphere is called a concave mirror A spherical mirror whose reflecting surface is curved outwards is called a convex mirror The schematic representation of these mirrors is shown in Fig 91 You may note in these diagrams that the back of the mirror is shaded You
