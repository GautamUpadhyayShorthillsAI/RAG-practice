properties of the mixture are the same as that of its constituents The number of elements known at present are more than 100 Ninetytwo elements are naturally occurring and the rest are manmade Majority of the elements are solid Eleven elements are in gaseous state at room temperature Two elements are liquid at room temperaturemercury and bromine Elements gallium and cesium become liquid at a temperature slightly above room temperature 303 K 202425 IS MATTER AROUND US PURE 21 The material obtained by group II is a compound On heating the two elements strongly we get a compound which has totally different properties compared to the combining elements The composition of a compound is the same throughout We can also observe that the texture and the colour of the compound are the same throughout Thus we can summarise the physical and chemical nature of matter in the following graphical organiser Table 22 Mixtures and Compounds Mixtures Compounds 1 Elements or compounds just mix 1 Elements
