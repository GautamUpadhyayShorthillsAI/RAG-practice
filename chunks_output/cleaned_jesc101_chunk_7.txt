by the following chemical equation Zn H2SO4 ZnSO4 H2 13 Let us examine the number of atoms of different elements on both sides of the arrow Element Number of atoms in Number of atoms reactants LHS in products RHS Zn 1 1 H 2 2 S 1 1 O 4 4 As the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the arrow Eq 13 is a balanced chemical equation Let us try to balance the following chemical equation Fe H2O Fe3O4 H2 14 202425 Science 4 Step I To balance a chemical equation first draw boxes around each formula Do not change anything inside the boxes while balancing the equation Fe H2O Fe3O4 H2 15 Step II List the number of atoms of different elements present in the unbalanced equation 15 Element Number of atoms Number of atoms in reactants LHS in products RHS Fe 1 3 H 2 2 O 1 4 To equalise the number of atoms it must be remembered that we cannot alter the formulae of the compounds or elements involved in the reactions For example to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient 4 as
