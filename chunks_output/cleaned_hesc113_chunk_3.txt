Fig 131 Arrangement for showing reflection 202425 SCIENCE 166 A ray of light is an idealisation In reality we have a narrow beam of light which is made up of several rays For simplicity we use the term ray for a narrow beam of light Draw lines showing the position of the plane mirror the incident ray and the reflected ray on the paper with the help of your friends Remove the mirror and the comb Draw a line making an angle of 90 to the line representing the mirror at the point where the incident ray strikes the mirror This line is known as the normal to the reflecting surface at that point Fig 132 The angle Table 131 Angles of Incidence and Reflection S Angle of Angle of No Incidence i Reflection r 1 2 3 4 5 Do you see any relation between the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection Are they approximately equal If the experiment is carried out carefully it is seen that the angle of incidence is always equal to the angle of reflection This is one of the laws of reflection Let us
