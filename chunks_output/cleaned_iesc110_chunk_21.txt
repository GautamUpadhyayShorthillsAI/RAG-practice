string on the bow What happened How did the slinky acquire energy when stretched Would the slinky acquire energy when it is compressed Activity 1010 Take a toy car Wind it using its key Place the car on the ground Did it move From where did it acquire energy Does the energy acquired depend on the number of windings How can you test this 202425 SCIENCE 120 1024 POTENTIAL ENERGY OF AN OBJECT AT A HEIGHT An object increases its energy when raised through a height This is because work is done on it against gravity while it is being raised The energy present in such an object is the gravitational potential energy The gravitational potential energy of an object at a point above the ground is defined as the work done in raising it from the ground to that point against gravity It is easy to arrive at an expression for the gravitational potential energy of an object at a height Fig 107 Consider an object of mass m Let it be raised through a height h from the ground A force is required to do
