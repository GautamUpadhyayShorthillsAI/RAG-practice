immersed Add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid to the water n Take two test tubes filled with water and invert them over the two carbon electrodes n Switch on the current and leave the apparatus undisturbed for some time n You will observe the formation of bubbles at both the electrodes These bubbles displace water in the test tubes n Is the volume of the gas collected the same in both the test tubes n Once the test tubes are filled with the respective gases remove them carefully n Test these gases one by one by bringing a burning candle close to the mouth of the test tubes CAUTION This step must be performed carefully by the teacher n What happens in each case n Which gas is present in each test tube Figure 16 Electrolysis of water 2PbNO32s Heat 2PbOs 4NO2g O2g 121 Lead nitrate Lead oxide Nitrogen Oxygen dioxide Let us perform some more decomposition reactions as given in Activities 17 and 18 202425 Science 10 10 10 10 10 Figure 18 a Iron nails dipped in copper sulphate solution Q
