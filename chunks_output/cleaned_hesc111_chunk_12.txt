the tester inserted into the potato When he came back after half an hour he noticed that there was a greenish blue spot on the potato around one wire whereas there was no such spot around the other wire Fig 116 carbon rods you may take two iron nails about 6 cm long Pour a cupful of water in a glassplastic bowl Add a teaspoonful of salt or a few drops of lemon juice to water to make it more conducting Now immerse the electrodes in this solution Make sure that the metal caps of the carbon rods are outside the water Wait for 34 minutes Observe the electrodes carefully Do you notice any gas bubbles near the electrodes Can we call the change taking place in the solution a chemical change Recall the definition of a chemical change that you learnt in Class VII In 1800 a British chemist William Nicholson 17531815 had shown that if electrodes were immersed in water and a current was passed bubbles of oxygen and hydrogen were produced Oxygen bubbles formed on the electrode connected to the
