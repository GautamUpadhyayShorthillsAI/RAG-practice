1 An object experiences a net zero external unbalanced force Is it possible for the object to be travelling with a nonzero velocity If yes state the conditions that must be placed on 2 When a carpet is beaten with a stick dust comes out of it Explain 3 Why is it advised to tie any luggage kept on the roof of a bus with a rope 4 A batsman hits a cricket ball which then rolls on a level ground After covering a short distance the ball comes to rest The ball slows to a stop because a the batsman did not hit the ball hard enough b velocity is proportional to the force exerted on the ball c there is a force on the ball opposing the motion d there is no unbalanced force on the ball so the ball would want to come to rest 5 A truck starts from rest and rolls down a hill with a constant acceleration It travels a distance of 400 m in 20 s Find its acceleration Find the force acting on it if its mass is 7 tonnes Hint 1 tonne 1000 kg 6 A stone of 1 kg is thrown with a velocity of 20 m s1 across
