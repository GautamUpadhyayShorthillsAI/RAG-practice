different but the mass number of both these elements is 40 That is the total number of nucleons is the same in the atoms of this pair of elements Atoms of different elements with different atomic numbers which have the same mass number are known as isobars uestions 1 For the symbol HD and T tabulate three subatomic particles found in each of them 2 Write the electronic configuration of any one pair of isotopes and isobars What you have learnt Credit for the discovery of electron and proton goes to JJ Thomson and EGoldstein respectively JJ Thomson proposed that electrons are embedded in a positive sphere 202425 SCIENCE 46 Rutherfords alphaparticle scattering experiment led to the discovery of the atomic nucleus Rutherfords model of the atom proposed that a very tiny nucleus is present inside the atom and electrons revolve around this nucleus The stability of the atom could not be explained by this model Neils Bohrs model of the atom was more successful He proposed that electrons are
