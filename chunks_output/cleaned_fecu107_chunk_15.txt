Take some warm water in a beaker Dip the thermometer in water so that the bulb is immersed in water Fig 74 Observe the rise of liquid column in the thermometer Wait till the column stops rising and note the temperature do not wait too long otherwise the water itself will start to cool What is the temperature of water measured by you Compare it with the readings of your friends Do you notice that as soon as you take the thermometer out of the water the level of liquid column begins to fall This means that the temperature must be read while the thermometer is immersed in water Fig74 Measuring temperature of warm water Laboratory thermometer Closeup of a part of laboratory thermometer Warm water Beaker Can we use a laboratory thermometer for measuring body temperature of a person should be directly in line with the level of the liquid column to be read Fig 74 Temperature and its Measurement 133 Activity 76 Let us compare Phibans Science teacher arranged the experimental setup for
