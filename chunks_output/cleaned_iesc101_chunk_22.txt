is called atmospheric pressure The atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1 atmosphere and is taken as the normal atmospheric pressure Fig 17 Sublimation of camphor Fig 18 By applying pressure particles of matter can be brought close together Applying pressure and reducing temperature can liquefy gases Have you heard of solid carbon dioxide CO2 It is stored under high pressure Solid CO2 gets converted directly into gaseous state on decrease of pressure to 1 atmosphere without coming into liquid state This is the reason that solid carbon dioxide is also known as dry ice Thus we can say that pressure and temperature determine the state of a substance whether it will be solid liquid or gas Now heat slowly and observe What do you infer from the above activity A change of state directly from solid to gas without changing into liquid state is called sublimation and the direct change of gas to solid without changing into liquid is called deposition 142 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF PRESSURE We have
