used in Activity 73 and observe it carefully Note down the following How much is the temperature difference indicated between the two bigger marks How many divisions shown by smaller marks are there between these two bigger marks How much temperature does one small division indicate So the smallest value that the thermometer can read is Fig 73b shows a closeup of a part of the thermometer shown in Fig 73a Can you now find the smallest value that this thermometer can read For the thermometer shown in Fig 73b the temperature difference indicated between 0 C and 10 C or between 10 C and 20 C is 10 C And the number of divisions between these marks are 10 divisions So one small division can read 1010 1 C That is the smallest value that this thermometer can read is 1 C Your school laboratory may have thermometers for which the range and the value of the smallest division may be different It is therefore always necessary to look carefully at the thermometer you are about to use You have
