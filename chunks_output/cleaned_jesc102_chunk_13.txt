n Take solutions of glucose alcohol hydrochloric acid sulphuric acid etc n Fix two nails on a cork and place the cork in a 100 mL beaker n Connect the nails to the two terminals of a 6 volt battery through a bulb and a switch as shown in Fig 23 n Now pour some dilute HCl in the beaker and switch on the current n Repeat with dilute sulphuric acid n What do you observe n Repeat the experiment separately with glucose and alcohol solutions What do you observe now n Does the bulb glow in all cases Figure 23 Figure 23 Figure 23 Figure 23 Figure 23 Acid solution in water conducts electricity 202425 Acids Bases and Salts 23 The bulb will start glowing in the case of acids as shown in Fig 23 But you will observe that glucose and alcohol solutions do not conduct electricity Glowing of the bulb indicates that there is a flow of electric current through the solution The electric current is carried through the acidic solution by ions Acids contain H ion as cation and anion such as Cl in HCl NO3 in
