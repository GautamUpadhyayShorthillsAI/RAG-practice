through R2 and R3 Let these be I2 and I3 respectively What is the relationship between I I1 I2 and I3 It is observed that the total current I is equal to the sum of the separate currents through each branch of the combination I I1 I2 I3 1115 Let Rp be the equivalent resistance of the parallel combination of resistors By applying Ohms law to the parallel combination of resistors we have I VRp 1116 On applying Ohms law to each resistor we have I1 V R1 I2 V R2 and I3 V R3 1117 From Eqs 1115 to 1117 we have VRp VR1 VR2 VR3 or 1Rp 1R1 1R2 1R3 1118 Thus we may conclude that the reciprocal of the equivalent resistance of a group of resistances joined in parallel is equal to the sum of the reciprocals of the individual resistances Example 118 In the circuit diagram given in Fig 1110 suppose the resistors R1 R2 and R3 have the values 5 10 30 respectively which have been connected to a battery of 12 V Calculate a the current through each resistor b the total current in the circuit and c the
