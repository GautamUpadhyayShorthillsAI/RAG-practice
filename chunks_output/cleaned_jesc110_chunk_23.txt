of the sky colour of water in deep sea the reddening of the sun at sunrise and the sunset are some of the wonderful phenomena we are familiar with In the previous class you have learnt about the scattering of light by colloidal particles The path of a beam of light passing through a true solution is not visible However its path becomes visible through a colloidal solution where the size of the particles is relatively larger 1061 Tyndall Effect The earths atmosphere is a heterogeneous mixture of minute particles These particles include smoke tiny water droplets suspended particles of dust and molecules of air When a beam of light strikes such fine particles the path of the beam becomes visible The light reaches us after being reflected diffusely by these particles The phenomenon of scattering of light by the colloidal particles gives rise to Tyndall effect which you have studied in Class IX This phenomenon is seen when a fine beam of sunlight enters a smokefilled room through a small
