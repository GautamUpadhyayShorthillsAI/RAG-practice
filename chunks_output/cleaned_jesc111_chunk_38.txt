H 100 J R 4 t 1 s V From Eq 1121 we have the current through the resistor as I HRt 100 J4 1 s 5 A Thus the potential difference across the resistor V from Eq 115 is V IR 5 A 4 20 V Figure 1113 Figure 1113 Figure 1113 Figure 1113 Figure 1113 A steady current in a purely resistive electric circuit 202425 Science 190 1171 Practical Applications of Heating Effect of Electric Current The generation of heat in a conductor is an inevitable consequence of electric current In many cases it is undesirable as it converts useful electrical energy into heat In electric circuits the unavoidable heating can increase the temperature of the components and alter their properties However heating effect of electric current has many useful applications The electric laundry iron electric toaster electric oven electric kettle and electric heater are some of the familiar devices based on Joules heating The electric heating is also used to produce light as in an electric bulb Here the filament must retain as
