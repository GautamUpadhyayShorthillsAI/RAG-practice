force does the table exert on the ball to bring it to rest Solution The initial velocity of the ball is 20 cm s1 Due to the frictional force exerted by the table the velocity of the ball decreases down to zero in 10 s Thus u 20 cm s1 v 0 cm s1 and t 10 s Since the velocitytime graph is a straight line it is clear that the ball moves with a constant acceleration The acceleration a is v u a t 0 cm s1 20 cm s110 s 2 cm s2 002 m s2 202425 FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 95 The force exerted on the ball F is F ma 201000 kg 002 m s2 00004 N The negative sign implies that the frictional force exerted by the table is opposite to the direction of motion of the ball 85 Third Law of Motion The first two laws of motion tell us how an applied force changes the motion and provide us with a method of determining the force The third law of motion states that when one object exerts a force on another object the second object instantaneously exerts a force back on the first These two forces are always equal
