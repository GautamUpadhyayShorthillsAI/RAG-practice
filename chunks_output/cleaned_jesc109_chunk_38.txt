For example kerosene having higher refractive index is optically denser than water although its mass density is less than water Material Refractive Material Refractive medium index medium index Air 10003 Canada 153 Balsam Ice 131 Water 133 Rock salt 154 Alcohol 136 Kerosene 144 Carbon 163 disulphide Fused 146 quartz Dense 165 flint glass Turpentine 147 oil Ruby 171 Benzene 150 Sapphire 177 Crown 152 glass Diamond 242 light in air and v is the speed of light in the medium then the refractive index of the medium nm is given by nm Speed of light in air Speed of light in the medium c v 97 The absolute refractive index of a medium is simply called its refractive index The refractive index of several media is given in Table 93 From the Table you can know that the refractive index of water nw 133 This means that the ratio of the speed of light in air and the speed of light in water is equal to 133 Similarly the refractive index of crown glass ng 152 Such data are helpful in many places
