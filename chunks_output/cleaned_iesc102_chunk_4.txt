is different This shows that a homogeneous mixture can have a variable composition Groups C and D have obtained mixtures which contain physically distinct parts and have nonuniform compositions Such mixtures are called heterogeneous mixtures Mixtures of sodium chloride and iron filings salt and sulphur and oil and water are examples of heterogeneous mixtures Activity 22 Let us again divide the class into four groups A B C and D Distribute the following samples to each group Few crystals of copper sulphate to group A One spatula full of copper sulphate to group B Chalk powder or wheat flour to group C Few drops of milk or ink to group D Each group should add the given sample in water and stir properly using a glass rod Are the particles in the mixture visible Direct a beam of light from a torch through the beaker containing the mixture and observe from the front Was the path of the beam of light visible Leave the mixtures undisturbed for a few minutes and set up the filtration
