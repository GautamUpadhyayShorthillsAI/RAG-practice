or near the surface of the earth G 2 M m mg R 98 G 2 M g R 99 The earth is not a perfect sphere As the radius of the earth increases from the poles to the equator the value of g becomes greater at the poles than at the equator For most 202425 SCIENCE 104 We know that an object experiences acceleration during free fall From Eq 99 this acceleration experienced by an object is independent of its mass This means that all objects hollow or solid big or small should fall at the same rate According to a story Galileo dropped different objects from the top of the Leaning Tower of Pisa in Italy to prove the same As g is constant near the earth all the equations for the uniformly accelerated motion of objects become valid with acceleration a replaced by g The equations are v u at 910 s ut 1 2 at2 911 v2 u2 2as 912 where u and v are the initial and final velocities and s is the distance covered in time t In applying these equations we will take acceleration a to be positive when it is in the
