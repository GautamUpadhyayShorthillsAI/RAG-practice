The simplest type of motion is the motion along a straight line We shall first learn to describe this by an example Consider the motion of an object moving along a straight path The object starts its journey from O which is treated as its reference point Fig 71 Let A B and C represent the position of the object at different instants At first the object moves through C and B and reaches A Then it moves back along the same path and reaches C through B are used to describe the overall motion of an object and to locate its final position with reference to its initial position at a given time Activity 73 Take a metre scale and a long rope Walk from one corner of a basketball court to its oppposite corner along its sides Measure the distance covered by you and magnitude of the displacement What difference would you notice between the two in this case Activity 74 Automobiles are fitted with a device that shows the distance travelled Such a device is known as an odometer A car is driven from
