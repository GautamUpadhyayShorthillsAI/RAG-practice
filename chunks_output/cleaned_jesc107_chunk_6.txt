there would be some chance for them to survive Thus if there were a population of bacteria living in temperate waters and if the water temperature were to be increased by global warming most of these bacteria would die but the few variants resistant to heat would survive and grow further Variation is thus useful for the survival of species over time Q U E S T I O N S 1 What is the importance of DNA copying in reproduction 2 Why is variation beneficial to the species but not necessarily for the individual 202425 How do Organisms Reproduce 115 Figure 71a Figure 71a Figure 71a Figure 71a Figure 71a Binary fission in Amoeba Activity 72 Activity 72 Activity 72 Activity 72 Activity 72 72 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE 72 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE 72 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE 72 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE 72 MODES OF REPRODUCTION USED BY SINGLE ORGANISMS ORGANISMS ORGANISMS ORGANISMS ORGANISMS Activity 71 Activity 71 Activity 71 Activity 71 Activity 71 n
