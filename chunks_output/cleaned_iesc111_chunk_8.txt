we already know sound propagates in the medium as a series of compressions and rarefactions Now we can compare the propagation of disturbance in a slinky with the sound propagation in the medium These waves are called longitudinal waves In these waves the individual particles of the medium move in a direction parallel to the direction of propagation of the disturbance The particles do not move from one place to another but they simply oscillate back and forth about their position of rest This is exactly how a sound wave propagates hence sound waves are longitudinal waves There is also another type of wave called a transverse wave In a transverse wave particles do not oscillate along the direction of wave propagation but oscillate up and down about their mean position as the wave travels Thus a transverse wave is the one in which the individual particles of the medium move about their mean positions in a direction perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation When we drop a pebble
