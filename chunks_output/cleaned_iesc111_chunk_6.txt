112 Propagation of Sound Sound is produced by vibrating objects The matter or substance through which sound is transmitted is called a medium It can be solid liquid or gas Sound moves through a medium from the point of generation to the listener When an object vibrates it sets the particles of the medium around it vibrating The particles do not travel all the way from Fig 114 A vibrating object creating a series of compressions C and rarefactions R in the medium 202425 SOUND 129 propagates through the medium Compression is the region of high pressure and rarefaction is the region of low pressure Pressure is related to the number of particles of a medium in a given volume More density of the particles in the medium gives more pressure and vice versa Thus propagation of sound can be visualised as propagation of density variations or pressure variations in the medium uestion 1 How does the sound produced by a vibrating object in a medium reach your ear 2 Explain how sound is produced by
