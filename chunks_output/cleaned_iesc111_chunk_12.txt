117 Thus a high pitch sound corresponds to more number of compressions and rarefactions passing a fixed point per unit time Objects of different sizes and conditions vibrate at different frequencies to produce sounds of different pitch The magnitude of the maximum disturbance in the medium on either side of the mean value is called the amplitude of the wave It is usually represented by the letter A as shown in Fig 116c For sound its unit will be that of density or pressure The loudness or softness of a sound is determined basically by its amplitude The amplitude of the sound wave depends upon the force with which an object is made to vibrate If we strike a table lightly we hear a soft sound because we produce a sound wave density of the medium oscillates between a maximum value and a minimum value The change in density from the maximum value to the minimum value then again to the maximum value makes one complete oscillation The number of such oscillations per unit time is the
