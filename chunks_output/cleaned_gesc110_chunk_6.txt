bulb glows only when the switch is in the ON position and the electric circuit is closed Fig 104 A cell holder Fig 105 Another type of cell holder Paheli and Boojho wonder whether the batteries used in tractors trucks and inverters are also made from cells Then why is it called a battery Can you help them to find the answer to this question Fig 106 Truck battery and its cutout Reprint 202425 SCIENCE 112 electric current passes through it When the bulb gets fused its filament is broken Fig 108 Circuit diagram of electric circuit shown in Fig 107 Fig 109 Another circuit diagram If the filament of the bulb is broken would the circuit be complete Would the bulb still glow You might have noticed that a glowing electric bulb become warm Do you know why 102 HEATING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT Activity 102 Take an electric cell a bulb a switch and connecting wires Make an electric circuit as shown in Fig109 This activity has to be done using only one cell Keep the switch in the OFF Fig 107 An
