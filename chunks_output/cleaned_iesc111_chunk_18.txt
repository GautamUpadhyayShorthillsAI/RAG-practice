which may be polished or rough is needed for the reflection of sound waves Activity 115 Take two identical pipes as shown in Fig 119 You can make the pipes using chart paper The length of the pipes should be sufficiently long as shown Arrange them on a table near a wall Keep a clock near the open end of one of the pipes and try to hear the sound of the clock through the other pipe Adjust the position of the pipes so that you can best hear the sound of the clock Now measure the angles of incidence and reflection and see the relationship between the angles Lift the pipe on the right vertically to a small height and observe what happens In place of a clock a mobile phone on vibrating mode may also be used Q Q 1123 SPEED OF SOUND IN DIFFERENT MEDIA Sound propagates through a medium at a finite speed The sound of a thunder is heard a little later than the flash of light is seen So we can make out that sound travels with a speed which is much less than the speed of light The speed of sound
