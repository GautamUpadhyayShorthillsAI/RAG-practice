in which the same functional group is attached to carbon chains of different lengths n The functional groups such as alcohols aldehydes ketones and carboxylic acids bestow characteristic properties to the carbon compounds that contain them n Carbon and its compounds are some of our major sources of fuels n Ethanol and ethanoic acid are carbon compounds of importance in our daily lives n The action of soaps and detergents is based on the presence of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in the molecule and this helps to emulsify the oily dirt and hence its removal E X E R C I S E S 1 Ethane with the molecular formula C2H6 has a 6 covalent bonds b 7 covalent bonds c 8 covalent bonds d 9 covalent bonds 2 Butanone is a fourcarbon compound with the functional group a carboxylic acid b aldehyde c ketone d alcohol 3 While cooking if the bottom of the vessel is getting blackened on the outside it means that a the food is not cooked completely b the fuel is not burning completely c the fuel
