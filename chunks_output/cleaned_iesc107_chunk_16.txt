motion On the other hand an object can travel with nonuniform acceleration if its velocity changes at a nonuniform rate For example if a car travelling along a straight road increases its speed by unequal amounts in equal intervals of time then the car is said to be moving with nonuniform acceleration Activity Activity Activity Activity Activity 78 78 78 78 78 In your everyday life you come across a range of motions in which a acceleration is in the direction of motion b acceleration is against the direction of motion c acceleration is uniform d acceleration is nonuniform Can you identify one example each for the above type of motion Exampl Exampl Exampl Exampl Exampleeeee 74 Starting from a stationary position Rahul paddles his bicycle to attain a velocity of 6 m s1 in 30 s Then he applies brakes such that the velocity of the bicycle comes down to 4 m s1 in the next 5 s Calculate the acceleration of the bicycle in both the cases Solution Solution Solution Solution Solution In the
