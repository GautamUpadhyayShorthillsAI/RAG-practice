These are used to synthesise other components of food such as proteins and fats But proteins are nitrogenous substances which contain nitrogen From where do the plants obtain nitrogen Recall that nitrogen is present in abundance in gaseous form in the air However plants cannot absorb nitrogen in this form Soil has certain bacteria that convert gaseous nitrogen into a usable form and release it into the soil These are absorbed by the plants along with water Also you might have seen farmers adding fertilisers rich in nitrogen to the soil In this way the plants fulfil their requirements of nitrogen along with the other constituents Plants can then synthesise proteins and vitamins 13 OTHER MODES OF NUTRITION IN PLANTS There are some plants which do not have chlorophyll They cannot synthesise food How do they survive and from where do they derive nutrition Like humans and animals such plants depend on the food produced by other plants They use the heterotrophic mode of nutrition Look at
