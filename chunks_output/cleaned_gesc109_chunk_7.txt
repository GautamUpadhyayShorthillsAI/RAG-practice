consists of a small metallic ball or a piece of stone suspended from a rigid stand by a thread Fig 94 a The metallic ball is called the bob of the pendulum Fig 94 a shows the pendulum at rest in its mean position When the bob of the pendulum is released after taking it slightly to one side it begins to move to and fro Fig 94 b The to and fro motion of a simple pendulum is an example of a periodic or an oscillatory motion The pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when its bob starting from its mean position O moves To set the pendulum in motion gently hold the bob and move it slightly to one side Make sure that the string attached to the bob is taut while you displace it Now release the bob from its displaced position Remember that the bob is not to be pushed when it is released Note the time on the clock when the bob is at its mean position Instead of the mean position you may note the time when the bob is at one of its extreme positions Measure the time the pendulum
