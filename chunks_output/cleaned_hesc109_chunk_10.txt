parts of these machines In all the above cases we want to reduce Fig 912 Powder is sprinkled on the carrom board to reduce friction friction in order to increase efficiency When oil grease or graphite is applied between the moving part of a machine a thin layer is formed there and moving surfaces do not directly rub against each other Fig 913 Interlocking of irregularities is avoided to a great extent Movement becomes smooth The substances which reduce friction are called lubricants In some machines it may not be advisable to use oil as lubricant An air cushion between the moving parts is used to reduce friction We deliberately increase friction by using brake pads in the brake system of bicycles and automobiles When you are riding a bicycle the brake pads do not touch the wheels But when you press the brake lever these pads arrest the motion of the rim due to friction The wheel stops moving You might have seen that kabaddi players rub their hands with soil for a better grip of their
