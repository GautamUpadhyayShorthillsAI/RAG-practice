of features from parents to next generation in the form of DNA Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid molecules The DNA in the cell nucleus is the information source for making proteins If the information is changed different proteins will be made Different proteins will eventually lead to altered body designs Therefore a basic event in reproduction is the creation of a DNA copy Cells use chemical reactions to build copies of their DNA This creates two copies of the DNA in a reproducing cell and they will need to be separated from each other However keeping one copy of DNA in the original cell and simply pushing the other one out would not work 202425 Science 114 because the copy pushed out would not have any organised cellular structure for maintaining life processes Therefore DNA copying is accompanied by the creation of an additional cellular apparatus and then the DNA copies separate each with its own cellular apparatus Effectively a cell divides to give rise to two cells These two cells are of
