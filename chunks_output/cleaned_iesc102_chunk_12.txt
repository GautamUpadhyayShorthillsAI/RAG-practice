it does not scatter light any more 223 WHAT IS A COLLOIDAL SOLUTION The mixture obtained by group D in activity 22 is called a colloid or a colloidal solution The particles of a colloid are uniformly spread throughout the solution Due to the relatively smaller size of particles as compared to that of a suspension the mixture appears to be homogeneous But actually a colloidal solution is a heterogeneous mixture for example milk Because of the small size of colloidal particles we cannot see them with naked eyes But these particles can easily scatter a beam of visible light as observed in activity 22 This scattering of a beam of light is called the Tyndall effect after the name of the scientist who discovered this effect Tyndall effect can also be observed when a fine beam of light enters a room through a small hole This happens due to the scattering of light by the particles of dust and smoke in the air Fig 23 a Solution of copper sulphate does not show Tyndall effect b mixture of water
