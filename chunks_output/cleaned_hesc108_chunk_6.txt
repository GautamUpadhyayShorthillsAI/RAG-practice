Now recall what happened when you and your friend pushed the heavy box in the same direction in Activity 82 If the two forces act in the opposite directions on an object the net force acting on it is the difference between the two forces What did you observe in Activity 82 when both of you were pushing the heavy box from opposite directions Recall that in the tugofwar when two teams pull equally hard the rope does not move in any direction So we learn that a force could be larger or smaller than the other or equal to each other The strength of a force is usually expressed by its magnitude We have also to specify the direction in which a force acts Also if the direction or the magnitude of the applied force changes its effect also changes Activity 82 Choose a heavy object like a table or a box which you can move only by pushing hard Try to push it all by yourself Can you move it Now ask one of your friends to help you in pushing it in the same direction Fig 84a Is it easier to move it
