say that a force must be acting on the book opposing its motion This force is called the force of friction Fig 92 a b Friction opposes relative motion between the surfaces of the book and the table a b You will find the answers to such questions in this chapter 202425 You saw that if you apply the force along the left friction acts along the right If you apply the force along the right the friction acts along the left direction In both cases the force opposes the motion of the book The force of friction always opposes the applied force In the above activity the force of friction acts between the surface of the book and the surface of the table Is the friction the same for all the surfaces Does it depend on the smoothness of the surfaces Let us find out 92 Factors affecting Friction Activity 92 Tie a string around a brick Pull the brick by a spring balance Fig 93 You need to apply some force Note down the reading on the spring balance when the brick just begins to move It gives you a
