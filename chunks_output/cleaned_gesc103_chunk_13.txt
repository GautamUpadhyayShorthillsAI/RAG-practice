by the process of conduction Do all substances conduct heat easily You must have observed that the metallic pan for cooking has a plastic or wooden handle Can you lift a hot pan by holding it from the handle without getting hurt Activity 37 Heat water in a small pan or a beaker Collect some articles such as a steel spoon plastic scale pencil and divider Dip one end of each of these articles in hot water Fig 38 Wait for a few minutes Touch the other end Enter your observation in Table 33 The materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are conductors of heat For examples aluminum iron and copper The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are poor conductors of heat such as plastic and wood Poor conductors are known as insulators The water and air are poor conductors of heat Then how does the heat transfer take place in these substances Let us find out Activity 38 Take a round bottom flask if flask is not available a beaker can be used Fill it twothirds
