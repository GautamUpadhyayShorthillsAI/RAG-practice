us It cannot reach us by conduction or convection as there is no medium such as air in most part of the space between the earth and the sun and water from the sides moves down This process continues till the whole water gets heated This mode of heat transfer is known as convection How does the heat travel in air In which direction does the smoke go The air near the heat source gets hot and rises The air from the sides comes in to take its place In this way the air gets heated The following activity confirms this idea Activity 39 Light a candle Keep one hand above the flame and one hand on the side of the flame Fig 310 Do your hands feel equally hot If not which hand feels hotter And why Fig 310 Transfer of heat by convection in air Fig 39 Convection of heat in water Be careful Keep your hands at a safe distance from the flame so that they do not get burnt Reprint 202425 SCIENCE 32 From the sun the heat comes to us by another process known as radiation The transfer of heat by radiation
