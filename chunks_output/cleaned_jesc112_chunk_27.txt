field Two main organs in the human body where the magnetic field produced is significant are the heart and the brain The magnetic field inside the body forms the basis of obtaining the images of different body parts This is done using a technique called Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI Analysis of these images helps in medical diagnosis Magnetism has thus got important uses in medicine More to Know 202425 Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 205 Figure 1215 Figure 1215 Figure 1215 Figure 1215 Figure 1215 A schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits Q U E S T I O N S Figure 1215 gives a schematic diagram of one of the common domestic circuits In each separate circuit different appliances can be connected across the live and neutral wires Each appliance has a separate switch to ONOFF the flow of current through it In order that each appliance has equal potential difference they are connected parallel to each other Electric fuse is an important component of all domestic
