on the surface of the moon is only 1 6 as strong as gravitational force on the earth What is the weight in newtons of a 10 kg object on the moon and on the earth 202425 SCIENCE 112 13 A ball is thrown vertically upwards with a velocity of 49 ms Calculate i the maximum height to which it rises ii the total time it takes to return to the surface of the earth 14 A stone is released from the top of a tower of height 196 m Calculate its final velocity just before touching the ground 15 A stone is thrown vertically upward with an initial velocity of 40 ms Taking g 10 ms2 find the maximum height reached by the stone What is the net displacement and the total distance covered by the stone 16 Calculate the force of gravitation between the earth and the Sun given that the mass of the earth 6 1024 kg and of the Sun 2 1030 kg The average distance between the two is 15 1011 m 17 A stone is allowed to fall from the top of a tower 100 m high and at the same time another stone is projected vertically
