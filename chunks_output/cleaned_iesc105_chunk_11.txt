put an animal cell or a plant cell into a solution of sugar or salt in water One of the following three things could happen 1 If the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell meaning that the outside solution is very dilute the cell will gain water by osmosis Such a solution is known as a hypotonic solution Water molecules are free to pass across the cell membrane in both directions but more water will come into the cell than will leave The net overall result is that water enters the cell The cell is likely to swell up 2 If the medium has exactly the same water concentration as the cell there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane Such a solution is known as an isotonic solution Water crosses the cell membrane in both directions but the amount going in is the same as the amount going out so there is no overall movement of water The cell will stay the same size 3 If the medium has a lower concentration of water than the cell meaning
