the stomach is acidic and has to be made alkaline for the pancreatic enzymes to act Bile juice from the liver accomplishes this in addition to acting on fats Fats are present in the intestine in the form of large globules which makes it difficult for enzymes to act on them Bile salts break them down into smaller globules increasing the efficiency of enzyme action This is similar to the emulsifying action of soaps on dirt that we have learnt about in Chapter 4 The pancreas secretes pancreatic juice which contains enzymes like trypsin for digesting proteins and lipase for breaking down emulsified fats The walls of the small intestine contain glands which secrete intestinal juice The enzymes present in it finally convert the proteins to amino acids complex carbohydrates into glucose and fats into fatty acids and glycerol Digested food is taken up by the walls of the intestine The inner lining of the small intestine has numerous fingerlike projections called villi which increase the
