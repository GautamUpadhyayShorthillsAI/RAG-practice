1011 N m2 kg2 More to know Q 202425 GRAVITATION 103 calculations we can take g to be more or less constant on or near the earth But for objects far from the earth the acceleration due to gravitational force of earth is given by Eq 97 921 TO CALCULATE THE VALUE OF g To calculate the value of g we should put the values of G M and R in Eq 99 namely universal gravitational constant G 67 1011 N m2 kg2 mass of the earth M 6 1024 kg and radius of the earth R 64 106 m G 2 M g R 11 2 2 24 6 2 67 10 N m kg 6 10 kg 64 10 m 98 m s2 Thus the value of acceleration due to gravity of the earth g 98 m s2 922 MOTION OF OBJECTS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF GRAVITATIONAL FORCE OF THE EARTH Let us do an activity to understand whether all objects hollow or solid big or small will fall from a height at the same rate Activity 93 Activity 93 Activity 93 Activity 93 Activity 93 Take a sheet of paper and a stone Drop them simultaneously from the first floor of a building Observe whether both of them reach the ground
