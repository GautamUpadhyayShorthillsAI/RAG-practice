in Fig 127 This is known as the righthand thumb rule Example 121 A current through a horizontal power line flows in east to west direction What is the direction of magnetic field at a point directly below it and at a point directly above it Solution The current is in the eastwest direction Applying the righthand thumb rule we get that the magnetic field at any point below or above the wire turns clockwise in a plane perpendicular to the wire when viewed from the east end and anticlockwise when viewed from the west end Figure 127 Figure 127 Figure 127 Figure 127 Figure 127 Righthand thumb rule This rule is also called Maxwells corkscrew rule If we consider ourselves driving a corkscrew in the direction of the current then the direction of the rotation of corkscrew is the direction of the magnetic field 1223 Magnetic Field due to a Current through a Circular Loop We have so far observed the pattern of the magnetic field lines produced around a currentcarrying straight wire Suppose this
