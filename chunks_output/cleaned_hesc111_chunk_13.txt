of oxygen and hydrogen were produced Oxygen bubbles formed on the electrode connected to the positive terminal of the battery and hydrogen bubbles formed on the other electrode The passage of an electric current through a conducting solution causes chemical reactions As a result bubbles of a gas may be formed on the electrodes Deposits of metal may be seen on electrodes Changes of colour of solutions may occur The reaction would depend on what solution and electrodes are used These are some of the chemical effects of the electric current Fig 116 Testing potato He was surprised with this observation and along with Paheli repeated this activity many times They found that it was always the wire connected to the positive terminal which had a greenish blue spot around it They felt that this discovery was very useful because it could be used for identifying the positive terminal of a cell or a battery concealed in a box They decided to report their finding to a childrens magazine Remember
