a low resistance is a good conductor A conductor having some appreciable resistance is called a resistor A component of identical size that offers a higher resistance is a poor conductor An insulator of the same size offers even higher resistance 115 FA 115 FA 115 FA 115 FA 115 FACTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST CTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST CTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST CTORS ON WHICH THE RESIST CTORS ON WHICH THE RESISTANCE OF A ANCE OF A ANCE OF A ANCE OF A ANCE OF A CONDUCTOR DEPENDS CONDUCTOR DEPENDS CONDUCTOR DEPENDS CONDUCTOR DEPENDS CONDUCTOR DEPENDS Figure 114 Figure 114 Figure 114 Figure 114 Figure 114 n Complete the circuit by connecting the nichrome wire in the gap XY Plug the key Note down the ammeter reading Take out the key from the plug Note Always take out the key from the plug after measuring the current through the circuit n Replace the nichrome wire with the torch bulb in the circuit and find the current through it by measuring the reading of the ammeter n Now repeat the above
