to arrive at the structure of simple carbon compounds the first step is to link the carbon atoms together with a single bond Fig 46a and then use the hydrogen atoms to satisfy the remaining valencies of carbon Fig 46b For example the structure of ethane is arrived in the following steps CC Step 1 Figure 46 Figure 46 Figure 46 Figure 46 Figure 46 a Carbon atoms linked together with a single bond Three valencies of each carbon atom remain unsatisfied so each is bonded to three hydrogen atoms giving Step 2 Figure 46 Figure 46 Figure 46 Figure 46 Figure 46 b Each carbon atom bonded to three hydrogen atoms The electron dot structure of ethane is shown in Fig 46c Can you draw the structure of propane which has the molecular formula C3H8 in a similar manner You will see that the valencies of all the atoms are satisfied by single bonds between them Such carbon compounds are called saturated compounds These compounds are normally not very reactive However another compound of carbon and
