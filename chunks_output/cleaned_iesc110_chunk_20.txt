as potential energy if it is not used to cause a change in the velocity or speed of the object You transfer energy when you stretch a rubber band The energy transferred to the band is its potential energy You do work while winding the key of a toy car The energy transferred to the spring inside is stored as potential energy The potential energy possessed by the object is the energy present in it by virtue of its position or configuration Activity 1012 Take a bamboo stick and make a bow as shown in Fig 106 Place an arrow made of a light stick on it with one end supported by the stretched string Now stretch the string and release the arrow Notice the arrow flying off the bow Notice the change in the shape of the bow The potential energy stored in the bow due to the change of shape is thus used in the form of kinetic energy in throwing off the arrow Q Fig106 An arrow and the stretched string on the bow What happened How did the slinky acquire energy when stretched Would the slinky
