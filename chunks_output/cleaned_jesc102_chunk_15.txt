n In which case does the litmus paper change colour n On the basis of the above Activity what do you infer about the acidic character of i dry HCl gas ii HCl solution Figure 24 Figure 24 Figure 24 Figure 24 Figure 24 Preparation of HCl gas This experiment suggests that hydrogen ions in HCl are produced in the presence of water The separation of H ion from HCl molecules cannot occur in the absence of water HCl H2O H3O Cl Hydrogen ions cannot exist alone but they exist after combining with water molecules Thus hydrogen ions must always be shown as Haq or hydronium ion H3O H H2O H3O We have seen that acids give H3O or Haq ion in water Let us see what happens when a base is dissolved in water NaOHs H O 2 Na aq OH aq Note to teachers If the climate is very humid you will have to pass the gas produced through a guard tube drying tube containing calcium chloride to dry the gas 202425 Science 24 KOHs K aqOH aq H O 2 MgOH2s H O 2 Mg2aq2OHaq Bases generate hydroxide OH ions in water Bases which
