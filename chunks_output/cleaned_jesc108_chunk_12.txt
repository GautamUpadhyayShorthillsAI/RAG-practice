control characteristics or traits If the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been discussing are correct then both parents must be contributing equally to the DNA of the progeny during sexual reproduction We have disscussed this issue in the previous Chapter If both parents can help determine the trait in the progeny both parents must be contributing a copy of the same gene This means that each pea plant must have two sets of all genes one inherited from each parent For this mechanism to work each germ cell must have only one gene set How do germcells make a single set of genes from the normal two copies that all other cells in the body have If progeny plants inherited a single whole gene set from each parent then the experiment explained in Fig 85 cannot work This is because the two characteristics R and y would then be linked to each other and cannot be independently Figure 84 Figure 84 Figure 84 Figure 84 Figure 84 202425 Science 132 inherited This is explained by the
