an object of mass m Let it be raised through a height h from the ground A force is required to do this The minimum force required to raise the object is equal to the weight of the object mg The object gains energy equal to the work done on it Let the work done on the object against gravity be W That is work done W force displacement mg h mgh Since work done on the object is equal to mgh an energy equal to mgh units is gained by the object This is the potential energy EP of the object Ep mgh 106 More to know The potential energy of an object at a height depends on the ground level or the zero level you choose An object in a given position can have a certain potential energy with respect to one level and a different value of potential energy with respect to another level It is useful to note that the work done by gravity depends on the difference in vertical heights of the initial and final positions of the object and not on the path along which the object is moved Fig 108 shows a case
