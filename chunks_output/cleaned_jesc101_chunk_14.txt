can say that when two or more substances elements or compounds combine to form a single product the reactions are called combination reactions In Activity 14 we also observed that a large amount of heat is evolved This makes the reaction mixture warm Reactions in which heat is released along with the formation of products are called exothermic chemical reactions Other examples of exothermic reactions are i Burning of natural gas CH4g 2O2 g CO2 g 2H2O g 117 ii Do you know that respiration is an exothermic process We all know that we need energy to stay alive We get this energy from the food we eat During digestion food is broken down into simpler substances For example rice potatoes and bread contain carbohydrates These carbohydrates are broken down to form glucose This glucose combines with oxygen in the cells of our body and provides energy The special name of this reaction is respiration the process of which you will study in Chapter 6 C6H12O6aq 6O2aq 6CO2aq 6H2Ol energy 118 Glucose
