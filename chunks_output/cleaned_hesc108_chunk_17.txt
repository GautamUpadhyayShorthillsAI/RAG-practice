to rest after some time What causes a change in their state of motion Could some force be acting on them Can you guess the direction in which the force must be acting in each case The force responsible for changing the state of motion of objects in all these examples is the force of friction It is the force of friction between the surface of the ball and the ground that brings the moving ball to rest Similarly friction between water and the boat brings it to a stop once you stop rowing The force of friction always acts on all the moving objects and its direction is always opposite to the direction of motion Since the force of friction arises due to contact between surfaces it is also an example of a contact force You will learn more about this force in Chapter 9 You may be wondering whether it is essential for the agent applying a force on an object to be always in contact with it Let us find out 87 Noncontact Forces Magnetic Force Activity 86 Take a pair of bar magnets Place the
