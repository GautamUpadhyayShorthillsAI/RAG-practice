in a minute 9 Does sound follow the same laws of reflection as light does Explain 10 When a sound is reflected from a distant object an echo is produced Let the distance between the reflecting surface and the source of sound production remains the same Do you hear echo sound on a hotter day 11 Give two practical applications of reflection of sound waves 12 A stone is dropped from the top of a tower 500 m high into a pond of water at the base of the tower When is the splash heard at the top Given g 10 m s2 and speed of sound 340 m s1 Sound properties such as pitch loudness and quality are determined by the corresponding wave properties 202425 SOUND 139 13 A sound wave travels at a speed of 339 m s1 If its wavelength is 15 cm what is the frequency of the wave Will it be audible 14 What is reverberation How can it be reduced 15 What is loudness of sound What factors does it depend on 16 How is ultrasound used for cleaning 17 Explain how defects in a metal block can be detected using
