a circular coil having large number of turns through them normal to the plane of the cardboard n Connect the ends of the coil in series with a battery a key and a rheostat as shown in Fig 129 n Sprinkle iron filings uniformly on the cardboard n Plug the key n Tap the cardboard gently a few times Note the pattern of the iron filings that emerges on the cardboard Figure 129 Figure 129 Figure 129 Figure 129 Figure 129 Magnetic field produced by a current carrying circular coil 1224 Magnetic Field due to a Current in a Solenoid A coil of many circular turns of insulated copper wire wrapped closely in the shape of a cylinder is called a solenoid The pattern of the magnetic field lines around a currentcarrying solenoid is shown in Fig 1210 Compare the pattern of the field with the magnetic field around a bar magnet Fig 124 Do they look similar Yes they are similar In fact one end of the solenoid behaves as a magnetic north pole while the other behaves as the south pole The field lines
