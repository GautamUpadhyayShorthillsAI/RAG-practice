the xaxis and the yaxis Let us try to understand this process with an example Let us again consider the motion of the bus that took Paheli and her friends to the picnic The distance covered and time taken by the bus are shown in Table 95 The total distance covered by the bus is 80 km If we decide to choose a scale 1 km 1 cm we shall have to draw an axis of length 80 cm This is not possible on a sheet of paper On the other hand a scale 10 km 1 cm would require an axis of length only 8 cm This scale is quite convenient However the graph may cover only a small part of the graph paper Some of the points to be kept in mind while choosing the most suitable scale for drawing a graph are the difference between the highest and the lowest values of each quantity the intermediate values of each quantity so that with the scale chosen it is convenient to mark the values on the graph and to utilise the maximum part of the paper on which the graph is to be drawn Suppose that you are given a graph
