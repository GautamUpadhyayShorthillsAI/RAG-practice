and R2 by an equivalent resistor of resistance R Similarly we replace the parallel resistors R3 R4 and R5 by an equivalent single resistor of resistance R Then using Eq 1118 we have 1 R 110 140 540 that is R 8 Similarly 1 R 130 120 160 660 that is R 10 Thus the total resistance R R R 18 To calculate the current we use Ohms law and get I VR 12 V18 067 A We have seen that in a series circuit the current is constant throughout the electric circuit Thus it is obviously impracticable to connect an electric bulb and an electric heater in series because they need currents of widely different values to operate properly see Example 113 Another major disadvantage of a series circuit is that when one component fails the circuit is broken and none of the components works If you have used fairy lights to decorate buildings on festivals on marriage celebrations etc you might have seen the electrician spending lot of time in troublelocating and replacing the dead bulb each has to be tested to find
