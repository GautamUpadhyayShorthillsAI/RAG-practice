is directly proportional to the current flowing through it provided its temperature remains the same This is called Ohms law In other words V I 114 or VI constant R or V IR 115 In Eq 114 R is a constant for the given metallic wire at a given temperature and is called its resistance It is the property of a conductor to resist the flow of charges through it Its SI unit is ohm represented by the Greek letter According to Ohms law R VI 116 If the potential difference across the two ends of a conductor is 1 V and the current through it is 1 A then the resistance R of the conductor is 1 That is 1 ohm 1 volt 1 ampere Also from Eq 115 we get I VR 117 It is obvious from Eq 117 that the current through a resistor is inversely proportional to its resistance If the resistance is doubled the current gets halved In many practical cases it is necessary to increase or decrease the current in an electric circuit A component used to regulate current without changing the voltage source is called
