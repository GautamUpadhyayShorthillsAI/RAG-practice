2 Activity 25 n Take a spatula full of sodium carbonate in a test tube and add 2 mL of dilute ethanoic acid n What do you observe n Pass the gas produced through freshly prepared limewater What do you observe n Can the gas produced by the reaction between ethanoic acid and sodium carbonate be identified by this test n Repeat this Activity with sodium hydrogencarbonate instead of sodium carbonate iii Reaction with carbonates and hydrogencarbonates Ethanoic acid reacts with carbonates and hydrogencarbonates to give rise to a salt carbon dioxide and water The salt produced is commonly called sodium acetate 2CH3COOH Na2CO3 2CH3COONa H2O CO2 CH3COOH NaHCO3 CH3COONa H2O CO2 Q U E S T I O N S 1 How would you distinguish experimentally between an alcohol and a carboxylic acid 2 What are oxidising agents 45 SOAPS AND DETERGENTS Activity 410 Activity 410 Activity 410 Activity 410 Activity 410 n Take about 10 mL of water each in two test tubes n Add a drop of oil cooking oil to both the test
