n Take about 10 mL of water each in two test tubes n Add a drop of oil cooking oil to both the test tubes and label them as A and B n To test tube B add a few drops of soap solution n Now shake both the test tubes vigourously for the same period of time n Can you see the oil and water layers separately in both the test tubes immediately after you stop shaking them n Leave the test tubes undisturbed for some time and observe Does the oil layer separate out In which test tube does this happen first Figure 412 Figure 412 Figure 412 Figure 412 Figure 412 Formation of micelles 202425 Carbon and its Compounds 75 This activity demonstrates the effect of soap in cleaning Most dirt is oily in nature and as you know oil does not dissolve in water The molecules of soap are sodium or potassium salts of longchain carboxylic acids The ionicend of soap interacts with water while the carbon chain interacts with oil The soap molecules thus form structures called micelles see Fig 412 where one end of
