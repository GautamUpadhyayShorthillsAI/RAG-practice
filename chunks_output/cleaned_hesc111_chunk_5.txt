140 Activity 113 Take the tray from inside a discarded matchbox Wrap an electric wire a few times around the tray Place a small compass needle inside it Now connect one free end of the wire to the terminal of a battery Leave the other end free Take another piece of wire and connect it to the other terminal of the battery Fig 114 Fig 114 Another tester sufficiently and it does not glow And why is the current in the circuit weak Well though a material may conduct electricity it may not conduct it as easily as a metal As a result the circuit of the tester may be complete and yet the current through it may be too weak to make the bulb glow Can we make another tester which can detect a weak current We can use another effect of an electric current to make another kind of tester Do you recall that electric current produces a magnetic effect What happens to a compass needle kept nearby when current flows in a wire Even if the current is small the deflection of the magnetic needle can be seen
