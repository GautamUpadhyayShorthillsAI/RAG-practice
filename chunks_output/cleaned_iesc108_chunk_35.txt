suffered a greater change in momentum as compared to the change in momentum of the motorcar because the change in the velocity of the insect was much more than that of the motorcar Akhtar said that since the motorcar was moving with a larger velocity it exerted a larger force on the insect And as a result the insect died Rahul while putting an entirely new explanation 202425 FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 99 said that both the motorcar and the insect experienced the same force and a change in their momentum Comment on these suggestions 17 How much momentum will a dumbbell of mass 10 kg transfer to the floor if it falls from a height of 80 cm Take its downward acceleration to be 10 m s2 Additional Exercises A1 The following is the distancetime table of an object in motion Time in seconds Distance in metres 0 0 1 1 2 8 3 27 4 64 5 125 6 216 7 343 a What conclusion can you draw about the acceleration Is it constant increasing decreasing or zero b What do you infer about the forces acting on
