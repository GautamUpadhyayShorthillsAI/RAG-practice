the synthesis of food occurs in the presence of sunlight it is called photosynthesis Photo light synthesis to combine So we find that chlorophyll sunlight carbon dioxide and water are necessary to carry out the process of photosynthesis It is a unique process on the earth The solar energy is captured by the leaves and stored in the plant in the form of food Thus sun is the ultimate source of energy for all living organisms Can you imagine life on earth in the absence of photosynthesis In the absence of photosynthesis there would not be any food The survival of almost all living organisms directly or indirectly depends upon the food made by the plants Besides oxygen which is essential for the survival You have seen that buildings are made of bricks Similarly the bodies of living organisms are made of tiny units called cells Cells can be seen only under the microscope Some organisms are made of only one cell The cell is enclosed by a thin outer boundary called the cell membrane Most
