participating in sexual reproduction must be somewhat different from each other for a number of reasons How is the sex of a newborn individual determined Different species use very different strategies for this Some rely entirely on environmental cues Thus in some animals like a few reptiles the temperature at which fertilised eggs are kept determines whether the animals developing in the eggs will be male or female In other animals such as snails individuals can change sex indicating that sex is not genetically determined However in human beings the sex of the individual is largely genetically determined In other words the genes inherited from our parents decide whether we will be boys or girls But so far we have assumed that similar gene sets are inherited from both parents If that is the case how can genetic inheritance determine sex The explanation lies in the fact that all human chromosomes are not paired Most human chromosomes have a maternal and a paternal copy and we have 22
