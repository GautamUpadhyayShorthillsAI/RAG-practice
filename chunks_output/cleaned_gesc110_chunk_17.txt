back to the OFF position Does the compass needle come back to its initial position Repeat the experiment a few times What does this experiment indicate We know that the needle of a compass is a tiny magnet which points in northsouth direction When we bring a magnet close to it the needle gets deflected We have also seen that compass needle gets deflected when the current flows in a nearby wire Can you connect the two observations When the current flows through a wire does the wire behave like a magnet This is what a scientist called Hans Christian Oersted Fig 1018 also wondered He was the first person who noticed the deflection of compass needle every time the current was passed through the wire So when electric current passes through a wire it behaves like a magnet This is the magnetic effect of the electric current In fact an electric current can be used to make magnets Do you find it too surprising Let us try it out Remember not to switch on the current for more than a few seconds
