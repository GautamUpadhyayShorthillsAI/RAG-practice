refracting surface of the prism Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab The peculiar shape of the prism makes the emergent ray bend at an angle to the direction of the incident ray This angle is called the angle of deviation In this case D is the angle of deviation Mark the angle of deviation in the above activity and measure it 104 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL 104 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL 104 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL 104 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GL 104 DISPERSION OF WHITE LIGHT BY A GLASS PRISM ASS PRISM ASS PRISM ASS PRISM ASS PRISM You must have seen and appreciated the spectacular colours in a rainbow How could the white light of the Sun give us various colours of the rainbow Before we take up this question we shall first go back to the refraction of light through a prism The inclined refracting surfaces of a glass prism show exciting phenomenon Let us find it out through an activity PE Incident ray i Angle of incidence EF
