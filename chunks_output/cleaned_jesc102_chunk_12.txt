of this gas 3 Metal compound A reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to produce effervescence The gas evolved extinguishes a burning candle Write a balanced chemical equation for the reaction if one of the compounds formed is calcium chloride 22 WHA 22 WHA 22 WHA 22 WHA 22 WHAT DO ALL ACIDS AND ALL BASES HA T DO ALL ACIDS AND ALL BASES HA T DO ALL ACIDS AND ALL BASES HA T DO ALL ACIDS AND ALL BASES HA T DO ALL ACIDS AND ALL BASES HAVE IN VE IN VE IN VE IN VE IN COMMON COMMON COMMON COMMON COMMON In Section 21 we have seen that all acids have similar chemical properties What leads to this similarity in properties We saw in Activity 23 that all acids generate hydrogen gas on reacting with metals so hydrogen seems to be common to all acids Let us perform an Activity to investigate whether all compounds containing hydrogen are acidic Activity 28 Activity 28 Activity 28 Activity 28 Activity 28 n Take solutions of glucose alcohol hydrochloric acid sulphuric acid etc n Fix two nails on a cork
