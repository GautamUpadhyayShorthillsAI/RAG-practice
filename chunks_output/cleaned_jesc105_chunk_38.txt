in animals that have high energy needs such as birds and mammals which constantly use energy to maintain their body temperature In animals that do not use energy for this purpose the body temperature depends on the temperature in the environment Such animals like amphibians or many reptiles have threechambered hearts and tolerate some mixing of the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood streams Fishes on the other hand have only two chambers to their hearts and the blood is pumped to the gills is oxygenated there and passes directly to the rest of the body Thus blood goes only once through the heart in the fish during one cycle of passage through the body On the other hand it goes through the heart twice during each cycle in other vertebrates This is known as double circulation Our pump the heart Figure 510 Figure 510 Figure 510 Figure 510 Figure 510 Schematic sectional view of the human heart Figure 511 Figure 511 Figure 511 Figure 511 Figure 511 Schematic representation of transport and
