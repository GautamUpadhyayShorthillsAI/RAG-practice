26 Activity 26 Activity 26 Activity 26 n Take about 2 mL of dilute NaOH solution in a test tube and add two drops of phenolphthalein solution n What is the colour of the solution n Add dilute HCl solution to the above solution drop by drop n Is there any colour change for the reaction mixture n Why did the colour of phenolphthalein change after the addition of an acid n Now add a few drops of NaOH to the above mixture n Does the pink colour of phenolphthalein reappear n Why do you think this has happened On passing excess carbon dioxide the following reaction takes place CaCO s CaHCO aq 3 3 H Ol CO g 2 2 2 Soluble in water Limestone chalk and marble are different forms of calcium carbonate All metal carbonates and hydrogencarbonates react with acids to give a corresponding salt carbon dioxide and water Thus the reaction can be summarised as In the above Activity we have observed that the effect of a base is nullified by an acid and viceversa The reaction taking place is written as
