It is the distance travelled by the sound wave in one time period T of the wave Thus v or v That is speed wavelength frequency The speed of sound remains almost the same for all frequencies in a given medium under the same physical conditions 202425 SOUND 133 uestion 1 Distinguish between loudness and intensity of sound uestion 1 In which of the three media air water or iron does sound travel the fastest at a particular temperature 113 Reflection of Sound Sound bounces off a solid or a liquid like a rubber ball bounces off a wall Like light sound gets reflected at the surface of a solid or liquid and follows the same laws of reflection as you have studied in earlier classes The directions in which the sound is incident and is reflected make equal angles with the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence and the three are in the same plane An obstacle of large size which may be polished or rough is needed for the reflection of sound waves Activity 115 Take two
