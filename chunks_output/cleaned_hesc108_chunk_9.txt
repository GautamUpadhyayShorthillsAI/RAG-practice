Fig 87 To move a tyre faster it has to be pushed repeatedly You might recall similar situations For example while taking a penalty kick in football the player applies a force on the ball Before being hit the ball was at rest and so its speed was zero The applied force makes the ball move towards the goal Suppose the goalkeeper dives or jumps up to save the goal By his action the goalkeeper tries to apply a force on the moving ball The force applied by him can stop or deflect the ball saving a goal being scored If the goalkeeper succeeds in stopping the ball its speed decreases to zero These observations suggest that a force applied on an object may change its speed If the force applied on the object is in the direction of its motion the speed of the object increases If the force is applied in the direction opposite to the direction of motion then it results in a decrease in the speed of the object 202425 SCIENCE 98 Let us consider some more examples In a game of volleyball players
