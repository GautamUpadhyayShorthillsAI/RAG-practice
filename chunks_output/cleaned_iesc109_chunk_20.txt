on an object perpendicular to the surface is called thrust When you stand on loose sand the force that is the weight of your body is acting on an area equal to area of your feet When you lie down the same force acts on an area equal to the contact area of your whole body which is larger than the area of your feet Thus the effects of forces of the same magnitude on different areas are different In the above cases thrust is the same But effects are different Therefore the effect of thrust depends on the area on which it acts The effect of thrust on sand is larger while standing than while lying The thrust on unit area is called pressure Thus thrust Pressure area 920 Substituting the SI unit of thrust and area in Eq 920 we get the SI unit of pressure as N m2 or N m2 In honour of scientist Blaise Pascal the SI unit of pressure is called pascal denoted as Pa Let us consider a numerical example to understand the effects of thrust acting on different areas Example 96 A block of wood is kept
