of sound is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the vibration producing the sound For example if the amplitude becomes twice the loudness increases by a factor of 4 The loudness is expressed in a unit called decibel dB The following table gives some idea of the loudness of sound coming from various sources Normal breathing 10 dB Soft whisper at 5m 30 dB Normal conversation 60 dB Busy traffic 70 dB Average factory 80 dB Above 80 dB the noise becomes physically painful I wonder why my voice is different from that of my teacher Compare the sound of a baby with that of an adult Is there any difference Even if two sounds are equally loud they differ in some way Let us see how Fig 1018 Frequency determines the pitch of a sound The loudness of sound depends on its amplitude When the amplitude of vibration is large the sound produced is loud When the amplitude is small the sound produced is feeble The frequency determines the shrillness or pitch of a sound If the frequency of
