remain the same Does the shape of the liquid remain the same When you pour the liquid from one container into another does it flow easily We observe that liquids have no fixed shape but have a fixed volume They take up the shape of the container in which they are kept Liquids flow and change shape so they are not rigid but can be called fluid Refer to activities 14 and 15 where we saw that solids and liquids can diffuse into liquids The gases from the atmosphere diffuse and dissolve in water These gases especially oxygen and carbon dioxide are essential for the survival of aquatic animals and plants All living creatures need to breathe for survival The aquatic animals can breathe under water due to the presence of dissolved oxygen in water Thus we may conclude that solids liquids and gases can diffuse into liquids The rate of diffusion of liquids is 202425 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 5 higher than that of solids This is due to the fact that in the liquid state particles move freely and
