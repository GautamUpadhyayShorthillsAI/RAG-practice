in Fig 116c A peak is called the crest and a valley is called the trough of a wave The distance between two consecutive compressions C or two consecutive rarefactions R is called the wavelength as shown in Fig 116c The wavelength is usually represented by Greek letter lambda Its SI unit is metre m H R Hertz Fig 116 Sound propagates as density or pressure variations as shown in a and b c represents graphically the density and pressure variations Frequency tells us how frequently an event occurs Suppose you are beating a drum How many times you are beating the drum in unit time is called the frequency of your beating the drum We know that when sound is propagated through a medium the 202425 SOUND 131 How the brain interprets the frequency of an emitted sound is called its pitch The faster the vibration of the source the higher is the frequency and the higher is the pitch as shown in Fig 117 Thus a high pitch sound corresponds to more number of compressions and rarefactions passing a
