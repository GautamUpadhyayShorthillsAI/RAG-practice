own cellular apparatus Effectively a cell divides to give rise to two cells These two cells are of course similar but are they likely to be absolutely identical The answer to this question will depend on how accurately the copying reactions involved occur No biochemical reaction is absolutely reliable Therefore it is only to be expected that the process of copying the DNA will have some variations each time As a result the DNA copies generated will be similar but may not be identical to the original Some of these variations might be so drastic that the new DNA copy cannot work with the cellular apparatus it inherits Such a newborn cell will simply die On the other hand there could still be many other variations in the DNA copies that would not lead to such a drastic outcome Thus the surviving cells are similar to but subtly different from each other This inbuilt tendency for variation during reproduction is the basis for evolution as we will discuss in the next chapter 711 The
