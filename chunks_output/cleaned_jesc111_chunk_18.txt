like rubber and glass have resistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 m Both the resistance and resistivity of a material vary with temperature Table 112 reveals that the resistivity of an alloy is generally higher than that of its constituent metals Alloys do not oxidise burn readily at high temperatures For this reason they are commonly used in electrical heating devices like electric iron toasters etc Tungsten is used almost exclusively for filaments of electric bulbs whereas copper and aluminium are generally used for electrical transmission lines Table 112 Electrical resistivity of some substances at 20C Material Resistivity m Conductors Silver 160 108 Copper 162 108 Aluminium 263 108 Tungsten 520 108 Nickel 684 108 Iron 100 108 Chromium 129 108 Mercury 940 108 Manganese 184 106 Alloys Constantan 49 106 alloy of Cu and Ni Manganin 44 106 alloy of Cu Mn and Ni Nichrome 100 106 alloy of Ni Cr Mn and Fe Insulators Glass 1010 1014 Hard rubber 1013 1016 Ebonite 1015 1017 Diamond 1012
