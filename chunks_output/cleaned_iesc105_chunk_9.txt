membrane allows or permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of the cell It also prevents movement of some other materials The cell membrane therefore is called a selectively permeable membrane How does the movement of substances take place into the cell How do substances move out of the cell Some substances like carbon dioxide or oxygen can move across the cell membrane by a process called diffusion We have studied the process of diffusion in earlier chapters We saw that there is spontaneous movement of a substance from a region of high concentration to a region where its concentration is low Something similar to this happens in cells when for example some substance like CO2 which is cellular waste and requires to be excreted out by the cell accumulates in high concentrations inside the cell In the cells external environment the concentration of CO2 is low as compared to that inside the cell As soon as there is a difference of concentration of CO2 inside and outside a
