will the athlete have to change his direction of motion while he completes one round It is clear that to move in a rectangular track once he has to change his direction of motion four times Now suppose instead of a rectangular track the athlete is running along a hexagonal shaped path ABCDEF as shown in Fig 78b In this situation the athlete will have to change his direction six times while he completes one round What if the track was not a hexagon but a regular octagon with eight equal sides as shown by ABCDEFGH in Fig 78c It is observed that as the number of sides of the track increases the athelete has to take turns more and more often What would happen to the shape of the track as we go on increasing the number of sides indefinitely If you do this you will notice that the shape of the track approaches the shape of a circle and the length of each of the sides will decrease to a point If the athlete moves with a velocity of constant magnitude along the circular path the only change
