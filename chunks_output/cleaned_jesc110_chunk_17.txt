distinct from the other The splitting of light into its component colours is called dispersion You have seen that white light is dispersed into its sevencolour components by a prism Why do we get these colours Different colours of light bend through different angles with respect to the incident ray as they pass through a prism The red light bends the least while the violet the most Thus the rays of each colour emerge along different paths and thus become distinct It is the band of distinct colours that we see in a spectrum Isaac Newton was the first to use a glass prism to obtain the spectrum of sunlight He tried to split the colours of the spectrum of white light further by using another similar prism However he could not get any more colours He then placed a second identical prism in an inverted position with respect to the first prism as shown in Fig 106 This allowed all the colours of the spectrum to pass through the second prism He found a beam of white light emerging from the
