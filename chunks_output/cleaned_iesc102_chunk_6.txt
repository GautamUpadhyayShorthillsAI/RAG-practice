or a gas dissolved in it But we can also have solid solutions alloys and gaseous solutions air In a solution there is homogeneity at the particle level For example lemonade tastes the same throughout This shows that particles of sugar or salt are evenly distributed in the solution Q Fig 22 Filtration Alloys Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals or a metal and a nonmetal and cannot be separated into their components by physical methods But still an alloy is considered as a mixture because it shows the properties of its constituents and can have variable composition For example brass is a mixture of approximately 30 zinc and 70 copper IS MATTER AROUND US PURE 15 202425 SCIENCE 16 A solution has a solvent and a solute as its components The component of the solution that dissolves the other component in it usually the component present in larger amount is called the solvent The component of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent usually present in lesser quantity is called the
