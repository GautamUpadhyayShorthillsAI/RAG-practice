on an ideal frictionless plane inclined on both sides Galileo argued that when the marble is released from left it would roll down the slope and go up on the opposite side to the same height from which it was released If the inclinations of the planes on both sides are equal then the marble will climb the same distance that it covered while rolling down If the angle of inclination of the rightside plane were gradually decreased then the marble would travel further distances till it reaches the original height If the rightside plane were ultimately made horizontal that is the slope is reduced to zero the marble would continue to travel forever trying to reach the same height that it was released from The unbalanced forces on the marble in this case are zero It thus suggests that an unbalanced external force is required to change the motion of the marble but no net force is needed to sustain the uniform motion of the marble In practical situations it is difficult to achieve a zero
