do so Kerosene oil forms a thin layer over the water surface This layer separates water from air and does not allow larvae and pupae to inhale air As a result they die Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 6 198 Activity 105 Let us analyse Let us solve an interesting puzzle How will you decide which stage larva or pupa comes immediately after the egg stage Suppose you are given a container with water from a puddle containing larvae and pupae Design an activity to find out the correct sequence of these stages You can take help of the following activity designed by Avadhi to create your own activity Step 1 I have a water container with mosquito larvae and pupae Step 2 I will separate 45 larvae and pupae into two separate containers with the same water Step 3 I will observe them every day until I see them changing to the next stage Step 4 If the larvae change into pupae it would mean that the larval stage comes before the pupal stage or viceversa Step 5 I will keep watching both the
