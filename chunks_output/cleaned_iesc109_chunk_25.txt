Now release the bottle It bounces back to the surface Does the force due to the gravitational attraction of the earth act on this bottle If so why doesnt the bottle stay immersed in water after it is released How can you immerse the bottle in water The force due to the gravitational attraction of the earth acts on the bottle in the downward direction So the bottle is pulled downwards But the water exerts an upward force on the bottle Thus the bottle is pushed upwards We have learnt that weight of an object is the force due to gravitational attraction of the earth When the bottle is immersed the upward force exerted by the Fig 95 An iron nail sinks and a cork floats when placed on the surface of water 202425 GRAVITATION 109 Observe what happens to elongation of the string or the reading on the balance You will find that the elongation of the string or the reading of the balance decreases as the stone is gradually lowered in the water However no further change is observed once the stone
