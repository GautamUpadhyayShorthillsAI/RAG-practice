on a scale called the Richter scale Really destructive earthquakes have magnitudes higher than 7 on the Richter scale Both Bhuj and Kashmir earthquakes had magnitudes greater than 75 Although we know for sure what causes an earthquake it is not yet possible to predict when and where the next earthquake might occur Tremors on the earth can also be caused when a volcano erupts or a meteor hits the earth or an underground nuclear explosion is Colliding Brushing past 202425 SCIENCE 160 The tremors produce waves on the surface of the earth These are called seismic waves The waves are recorded by an instrument called the seismograph Fig 1213 The instrument is simply a vibrating rod or a pendulum which starts vibrating when tremors occur A pen is attached to the vibrating system The pen records the seismic waves on a paper which moves under it By studying these waves scientists can construct a complete map of the earthquake as shown in Fig 1214 They can also estimate its power to cause
