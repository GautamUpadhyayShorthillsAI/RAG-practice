water conducts electricity or not What do you find Does distilled water conduct electricity Now dissolve a pinch of common salt in distilled water Again test What do you conclude this time When salt is dissolved in distilled water we obtain salt solution This is a conductor of electricity The water that we get from sources such as taps hand pumps wells and ponds is not pure It may contain 202425 SCIENCE 142 several salts dissolved in it Small amounts of mineral salts are naturally present in it This water is thus a good conductor of electricity On the other hand distilled water is free of salts and is a poor conductor Most liquids that conduct electricity are solutions of acids bases and salts When an electric current flows through a conducting solution does it produce an effect on the solution 112 Chemical Effects of Electric Current In Class VII we have learnt some effects of electric current Can you list these effects What effect does the current produce when it flows through a
