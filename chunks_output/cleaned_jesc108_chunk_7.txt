traits was seen not some mixture of the two So the next question was were the tall plants in the F1 generation exactly the same as the tall plants of the parent generation Mendelian experiments test this by getting both the parental plants and these F1 tall plants to reproduce by selfpollination The progeny of the parental plants are of course all tall However the secondgeneration or F2 progeny of the F1 tall plants are not all tall Instead one quarter of them are short This indicates that both the tallness and shortness traits were inherited in the F1 plants but only the tallness trait was expressed This led Mendel to propose that two copies of factor now called genes controlling traits are present in sexually reproducing organism These two may be identical or may be different depending on the parentage A pattern of inheritance can be worked out with this assumption as shown in Fig 83 Gregor Johann Mendel 18221884 Mendel was educated in a monastery and went on to study science and
