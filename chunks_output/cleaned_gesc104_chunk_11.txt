resulting solution is neither acidic nor basic Touch the test tube immediately after neutralisation What do you observe In neutralisation reaction heat is always produced or evolved The evolved heat raises the temperature of the reaction mixture In neutralisation reaction a new substance is formed This is called salt Salt may be acidic basic or neutral in nature Thus neutralisation can be defined as follows The reaction between an acid and a base is known as neutralisation Salt and water are produced in this process with the evolution of heat AcidBase SaltWater Heat is evolved The following reaction is an example Hydrochloric acid HCl Sodium hydroxide NaOH Sodium chloride NaCl Water H2O Boojho added dilute sulphuric acid to lime water Will the reaction mixture become hot or cool 44 NEUTRALISATION IN EVERYDAY LIFE Indigestion Our stomach contains hydrochloric acid It helps us to digest food as you have learnt in Chapter 2 But too much of acid in the stomach causes indigestion Sometimes
