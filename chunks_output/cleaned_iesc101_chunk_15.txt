the gaseous state the particles move about randomly at high speed Due to this random movement the particles hit each other and also the walls of the container The pressure exerted by the gas is because of this force exerted by gas particles per unit area on the walls of the container Fig 14 What do you observe In which case was the piston easily pushed in What do you infer from your observations Fig15 a b and c show the magnified schematic pictures of the three states of matter The motion of the particles can be seen and compared in the three states of matter 202425 SCIENCE 6 141 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE Activity 112 Take about 150 g of ice in a beaker and suspend a laboratory thermometer so that its bulb is in contact with the ice as in Fig 16 uestions 1 The mass per unit volume of a substance is called density density massvolume Arrange the following in order of increasing density air exhaust from chimneys honey water chalk cotton and iron 2 a Tabulate the differences in the
