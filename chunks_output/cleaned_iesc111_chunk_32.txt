The time taken by the wave for one complete oscillation of the density or pressure of the medium is called the time period T The number of complete oscillations per unit time is called the frequency 1 v T The speed v frequency and wavelength of sound are related by the equation v The speed of sound depends primarily on the nature and the temperature of the transmitting medium The law of reflection of sound states that the directions in which the sound is incident and reflected make equal angles with the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence and the three lie in the same plane For hearing a distinct sound the time interval between the original sound and the reflected one must be at least 01 s The persistence of sound in an auditorium is the result of repeated reflections of sound and is called reverberation These waves are then converted into electrical signals that are used to generate images of the organ These images are then displayed on a monitor or printed on
