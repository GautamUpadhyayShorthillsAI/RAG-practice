general pattern reproduction in such organisms is also the function of a specific cell type How is reproduction to be achieved from a single cell type if the organism itself consists of many cell types The answer is that there must be a single cell type in the organism that is capable of growing proliferating and making other cell types under the right circumstances 723 Regeneration Many fully differentiated organisms have the ability to give rise to new individual organisms from their body parts That is if the individual is somehow cut or broken up into many pieces many of these pieces grow into separate individuals For example simple animals like Hydra and Planaria can be cut into any number of pieces and each piece grows into a complete organism This is known as regeneration see Fig 73 Regeneration is carried out by specialised cells These cells proliferate and make large numbers of cells From this mass of cells different cells undergo changes to become various cell types and
