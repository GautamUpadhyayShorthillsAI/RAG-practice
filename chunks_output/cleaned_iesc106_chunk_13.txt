of cells in the vascular bundle Xylem consists of tracheids vessels xylem parenchyma Fig 67 abc and xylem fibres Tracheids and vessels have thick walls and many are dead cells when mature Tracheids and vessels are tubular structures This allows them to transport water and minerals vertically The parenchyma stores food Xylem fibres are mainly supportive in function Phloem is made up of five types of cells sieve cells sieve tubes companion cells phloem fibres and the phloem parenchyma Fig 67 d Sieve tubes are tubular cells with perforated walls Phloem transports food from leaves to other parts of the plant Except phloem fibres other phloem cells are living cells 622 ii COMPLEX PERMANENT TISSUE The different types of tissues we have discussed until now are all made of one type of cells which look like each other Such tissues are called simple permanent tissue Yet another type of permanent tissue is complex tissue Complex tissues are made of more than one type of cells All these cells
