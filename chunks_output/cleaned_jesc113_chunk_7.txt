autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and convert it into chemical energy This energy supports all the activities of the living world From autotrophs the energy goes to the heterotrophs and decomposers However as we saw in the previous Chapter on Sources of Energy when one form of energy is changed to another some energy is lost to the environment in forms which cannot be used again The flow of energy between various components of the environment has been extensively studied and it has been found that n The green plants in a terrestrial ecosystem capture about 1 of the energy of sunlight that falls on their leaves and convert it into food energy n When green plants are eaten by primary consumers a great deal of energy is lost as heat to the environment some amount goes into digestion and in doing work and the rest goes towards growth and reproduction An average of 10 of the food eaten is turned into its own body and made available for the next level of consumers n
