compound in water contains ions which move to the opposite electrodes when electricity is passed through the solution Ionic compounds in the solid state do not conduct electricity because movement of ions in the solid is not possible due to their rigid structure But ionic compounds conduct electricity in the molten state This is possible in the molten state since the elecrostatic forces of attraction between the oppositely charged ions are overcome due to the heat Thus the ions move freely and conduct electricity Q U E S T I O N S 1 i Write the electrondot structures for sodium oxygen and magnesium ii Show the formation of Na2O and MgO by the transfer of electrons iii What are the ions present in these compounds 2 Why do ionic compounds have high melting points 34 34 34 34 34 OCCURRENCE OF MET OCCURRENCE OF MET OCCURRENCE OF MET OCCURRENCE OF MET OCCURRENCE OF METALS ALS ALS ALS ALS The earths crust is the major source of metals Seawater also contains some soluble salts such as sodium
