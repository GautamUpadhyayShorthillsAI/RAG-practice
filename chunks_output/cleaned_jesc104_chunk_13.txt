bonds with other atoms of carbon giving rise to large molecules This property is called catenation These compounds may have long chains of carbon branched chains of carbon or even carbon atoms arranged in rings In addition carbon atoms may be linked by single double or triple bonds Compounds of carbon which are linked by only single bonds between the carbon atoms are called saturated compounds Compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between their carbon atoms are called unsaturated compounds No other element exhibits the property of catenation to the extent seen in carbon compounds Silicon forms compounds with hydrogen which have chains of upto seven or eight atoms but these compounds are very reactive The carboncarbon bond is very strong and hence stable This gives us the large number of compounds with many carbon atoms linked to each other ii Since carbon has a valency of four it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other monovalent
