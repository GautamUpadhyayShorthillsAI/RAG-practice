N m2 Thus the same force acting on a smaller area exerts a larger pressure and a smaller pressure on a larger area This is the reason why a nail has a pointed tip knives have sharp edges and buildings have wide foundations 951 PRESSURE IN FLUIDS All liquids and gases are fluids A solid exerts pressure on a surface due to its weight Similarly fluids have weight and they also Fig 94 202425 SCIENCE 108 water on the bottle is greater than its weight Therefore it rises up when released To keep the bottle completely immersed the upward force on the bottle due to water must be balanced This can be achieved by an externally applied force acting downwards This force must at least be equal to the difference between the upward force and the weight of the bottle The upward force exerted by the water on the bottle is known as upthrust or buoyant force In fact all objects experience a force of buoyancy when they are immersed in a fluid The magnitude of this buoyant force depends on the density of
