layer prevents the metal from further oxidation Iron does not burn on heating but iron filings burn vigorously when sprinkled in the flame of the burner Copper does not burn but the hot metal is coated with a black coloured layer of copperII oxide Silver and gold do not react with oxygen even at high temperatures Do You Know Anodising is a process of forming a thick oxide layer of aluminium Aluminium develops a thin oxide layer when exposed to air This aluminium oxide coat makes it resistant to further corrosion The resistance can be improved further by making the oxide layer thicker During anodising a clean aluminium article is made the anode and is electrolysed with dilute sulphuric acid The oxygen gas evolved at the anode reacts with aluminium to make a thicker protective oxide layer This oxide layer can be dyed easily to give aluminium articles an attractive finish After performing Activity 39 you must have observed that sodium is the most reactive of the samples of metals taken
