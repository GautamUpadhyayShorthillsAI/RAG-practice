using an inclined plane to slow down the rate of descent In 1592 he was appointed professor of mathematics at the University of Padua in the Republic of Venice Here he continued his observations on the theory of motion and through his study of inclined planes and the pendulum formulated the correct law for uniformly accelerated objects that the distance the object moves is proportional to the square of the time taken Galileo was also a remarkable craftsman He developed a series of telescopes whose optical performance was much better than that of other telescopes available during those days Around 1640 he designed the first pendulum clock In his book Starry Messenger on his astronomical discoveries Galileo claimed to have seen mountains on the moon the milky way made up of tiny stars and four small bodies orbiting Jupiter In his books Discourse on Floating Bodies and Letters on the Sunspots he disclosed his observations of sunspots Using his own telescopes and through his observations
