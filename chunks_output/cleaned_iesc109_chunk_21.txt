to understand the effects of thrust acting on different areas Example 96 A block of wood is kept on a tabletop The mass of wooden block is 5 kg and its dimensions are 40 cm 20 cm 10 cm Find the pressure exerted by the wooden block on the table top if it is made to lie on the table top with its sides of dimensions a 20 cm 10 cm and b 40 cm 20 cm Solution The mass of the wooden block 5 kg The dimensions 40 cm 20 cm 10 cm Here the weight of the wooden block applies a thrust on the table top That is Thrust F m g 5 kg 98 m s2 49 N Area of a side length breadth 20 cm 10 cm 200 cm2 002 m2 From Eq 920 Pressure 2 49N 002m 2450 N m2 When the block lies on its side of dimensions 40 cm 20 cm it exerts the same thrust Area length breadth 40 cm 20 cm 800 cm2 008 m2 From Eq 920 Pressure 2 49 N 008 m 6125 N m2 The pressure exerted by the side 20 cm 10 cm is 2450 N m2 and by the side 40 cm 20 cm is 6125 N m2 Thus the same force acting on a smaller area exerts a larger pressure and a smaller pressure
