n Make a parallel combination XY of three resistors having resistances R1 R2 and R3 respectively Connect it with a battery a plug key and an ammeter as shown in Fig 1110 Also connect a voltmeter in parallel with the combination of resistors n Plug the key and note the ammeter reading Let the current be I Also take the voltmeter reading It gives the potential difference V across the combination The potential difference across each resistor is also V This can be checked by connecting the voltmeter across each individual resistor see Fig 1111 Figure 1110 Figure 1110 Figure 1110 Figure 1110 Figure 1110 202425 Science 186 n Take out the plug from the key Remove the ammeter and voltmeter from the circuit Insert the ammeter in series with the resistor R1 as shown in Fig 1111 Note the ammeter reading I1 Figure 1111 Figure 1111 Figure 1111 Figure 1111 Figure 1111 n Similarly measure the currents through R2 and R3 Let these be I2 and I3 respectively What is the relationship between I I1 I2 and
