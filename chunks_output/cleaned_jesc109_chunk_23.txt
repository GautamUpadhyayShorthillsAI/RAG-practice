perpendicular to and above the principal axis along yaxis are taken as positive v Distances measured perpendicular to and below the principal axis along yaxis are taken as negative 202425 Light Reflection and Refraction 143 The New Cartesian Sign Convention described above is illustrated in Fig99 for your reference These sign conventions are applied to obtain the mirror formula and solve related numerical problems 924 Mirror Formula and Magnification In a spherical mirror the distance of the object from its pole is called the object distance u The distance of the image from the pole of the mirror is called the image distance v You already know that the distance of the principal focus from the pole is called the focal length f There is a relationship between these three quantities given by the mirror formula which is expressed as 1 1 1 v u f 91 This formula is valid in all situations for all spherical mirrors for all positions of the object You must use the New Cartesian Sign
