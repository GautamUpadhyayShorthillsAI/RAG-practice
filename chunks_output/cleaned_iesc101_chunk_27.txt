The spaces in between the constituent particles and kinetic energy of the particles are minimum in the case of solids intermediate in liquids and maximum in gases What happens when you pour some acetone nail polish remover on your palm The particles gain energy from your palm or surroundings and evaporate causing the palm to feel cool After a hot sunny day people sprinkle water on the roof or open ground because the large latent heat of vaporisation of water helps to cool the hot surface Can you cite some more examples from daily life where we can feel the effect of cooling due to evaporation Why should we wear cotton clothes in summer During summer we perspire more because of the mechanism of our body which keeps us cool We know that during evaporation the particles at the surface of the liquid gain energy from the surroundings or body surface and change into vapour The heat energy equal to the latent heat of vaporisation is absorbed from the body leaving the body cool Cotton being a
