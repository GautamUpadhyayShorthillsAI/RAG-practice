to refract light is also expressed in terms of its optical density Optical density has a definite connotation It is not the same as mass density We have been using the terms rarer medium and denser medium in this Chapter It actually means optically rarer medium and optically denser medium respectively When can we say that a medium is optically denser than the other In comparing two media the one with the larger refractive index is optically denser medium than the other The other medium of lower refractive index is optically rarer The speed of light is higher in a rarer medium than a denser medium Thus a ray of light travelling from a rarer medium to a denser medium slows down and bends towards the normal When it travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium it speeds up and bends away from the normal Note from Table 93 that an optically denser medium may not possess greater mass density For example kerosene having higher refractive index is optically denser than water although its
