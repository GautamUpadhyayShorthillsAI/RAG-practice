species The charged species are known as ions Ions may consist of a single charged atom or a group of atoms that have a net charge on them An ion can be negatively or positively charged A negatively charged ion is called an anion and the positively charged ion a cation Take for example sodium chloride NaCl Its constituent particles are positively charged sodium ions Na and negatively charged 332 MOLECULES OF COMPOUNDS Atoms of different elements join together in definite proportions to form molecules of compounds Few examples are given in Table 34 202425 SCIENCE 32 chloride ions Cl A group of atoms carrying a charge is known as a polyatomic ion Table 36 We shall learn more about the formation of ions in Chapter 4 learn the symbols and combining capacity of the elements The combining power or capacity of an element is known as its valency Valency can be used to find out how the atoms of an element will combine with the atoms of another element to form a chemical compound The valency of
