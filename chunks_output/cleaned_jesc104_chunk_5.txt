it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon cation with six protons in its nucleus holding on to just two electrons Carbon overcomes this problem by sharing its valence electrons with other atoms of carbon or with atoms of other elements Not just carbon but many other elements form molecules by sharing electrons in this manner The shared electrons belong to the outermost shells of both the atoms and lead to both atoms attaining the noble gas configuration Before going on to compounds of carbon let us look at some simple molecules formed by the sharing of valence electrons The simplest molecule formed in this manner is that of hydrogen As you have learnt earlier the atomic number of hydrogen is 1 Hence hydrogen has one electron in its K shell and it requires one more electron to fill the K shell So two hydrogen atoms share their electrons to form a molecule of hydrogen H2 This allows each hydrogen atom to attain the Table 41 Melting points
