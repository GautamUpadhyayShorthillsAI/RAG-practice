a poor conductor under all conditions This makes Boojho ask whether other materials classified as poor conductors also allow electricity to pass under certain conditions From Table 111 we find that some liquids are good conductors of electricity and some are poor conductors Actually under certain conditions most materials can conduct That is why it is preferable to classify materials as good conductors and poor conductors instead of classifying as conductors and insulators We have tested the conduction of electricity through tap water Let us now test the conduction of electricity through distilled water Activity 114 Take about two teaspoonfuls of distilled water in a clean and dry plastic or rubber cap of a bottle You may obtain distilled water from your school science lab You may also get distilled water from a medical store or a doctor or a nurse Use the tester to test whether distilled water conducts electricity or not What do you find Does distilled water conduct electricity Now
