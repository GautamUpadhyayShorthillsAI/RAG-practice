when they are immersed in a fluid The magnitude of this buoyant force depends on the density of the fluid 953 WHY OBJECTS FLOAT OR SINK WHEN PLACED ON THE SURFACE OF WATER Let us do the following activities to arrive at an answer for the above question Activity 95 Take a beaker filled with water Take an iron nail and place it on the surface of the water Observe what happens The nail sinks The force due to the gravitational attraction of the earth on the iron nail pulls it downwards There is an upthrust of water on the nail which pushes it upwards But the downward force acting on the nail is greater than the upthrust of water on the nail So it sinks Fig 95 exert pressure on the base and walls of the container in which they are enclosed Pressure exerted in any confined mass of fluid is transmitted undiminished in all directions 952 BUOYANCY Have you ever had a swim in a pool and felt lighter Have you ever drawn water from a well and felt that the bucket of water is heavier when it is
