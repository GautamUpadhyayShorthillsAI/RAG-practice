of the load with their head So the pressure on their head is reduced and they find it easier to carry the load Fig 813 A porter carrying a heavy load Fig 812 Pushing a nail into a wooden plank 202425 SCIENCE 104 Note that the area is in the denominator in the above expression So the smaller the area larger the pressure on a surface for the same force The area of the pointed end of the nail is much smaller than that of its head The same force therefore produces a pressure sufficient to push the pointed end of the nail into the wooden plank Can you explain now why shoulder bags are provided with broad straps and not thin strap And why the tools meant for cutting and piercing always have sharp edges Do liquids and gases also exert pressure Does it also depend on the area on which the force acts Let us find out 89 Pressure Exerted by Liquids and Gases Activity 88 Take a transparent glass tube or a plastic pipe The length of the pipe tube should be about 25 cm and its diameter should be
