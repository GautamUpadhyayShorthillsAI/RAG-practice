normal Compare the angle of incidence with the angle of refraction at both refracting surfaces AB and CD In Fig 910 a ray EO is obliquely incident on surface AB called incident ray OO is the refracted ray and O H is the emergent ray You may observe that the emergent ray is parallel to the direction of the incident ray Why does it happen so The extent of bending of the ray of light at the opposite parallel faces AB airglass interface and CD glassair interface of the rectangular glass slab is equal and opposite This is why the ray emerges parallel to the incident ray However the light ray is shifted sideward slightly What happens when a light ray is incident normally to the interface of two media Try and find out Now you are familiar with the refraction of light Refraction is due to change in the speed of light as it enters from one transparent medium to another Experiments show that refraction of light occurs according to certain laws Activity 910 Activity 910 Activity 910 Activity 910
