covered by it in a certain time interval by a set of equations known as the equations of motion For convenience a set of three such equations are given below v u at 75 s ut at2 76 2 as v2 u2 77 where u is the initial velocity of the object which moves with uniform acceleration a for time t v is the final velocity and s is the distance travelled by the object in time t Eq 75 describes the velocitytime relation and Eq 76 represents the positiontime relation Eq 77 which represents the relation between the position and the velocity can be obtained from Eqs 75 and 76 by eliminating t These three equations can be derived by graphical method Example 75 A train starting from rest attains a velocity of 72 km h1 in 5 minutes Assuming that the acceleration is uniform find i the acceleration and ii the distance travelled by the train for attaining this velocity Solution We have been given u 0 v 72 km h1 20 m s1 and t 5 minutes 300 s i From Eq 75 we know that v u a t 1 1 2 20 m s 0 m s 300s 1 m s
