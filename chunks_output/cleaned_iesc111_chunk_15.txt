The time taken by the wave to travel a distance d of 15 km is Thus sound will take 21 s to travel a distance of 15 km uestions 1 What are wavelength frequency time period and amplitude of a sound wave 2 How are the wavelength and frequency of a sound wave related to its speed 3 Calculate the wavelength of a sound wave whose frequency is 220 Hz and speed is 440 ms in a given medium 4 A person is listening to a tone of 500 Hz sitting at a distance of 450 m from the source of the sound What is the time interval between successive compressions from the source The amount of sound energy passing each second through unit area is called the intensity of sound We sometimes use the terms loudness and intensity interchangeably but they are not the same Loudness is a measure of the response of the ear to the sound Even when two sounds are of equal intensity we may hear one as louder than the other simply because our ear detects it better of less energy amplitude If we hit the table hard we hear a
