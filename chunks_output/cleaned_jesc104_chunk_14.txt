of four it is capable of bonding with four other atoms of carbon or atoms of some other monovalent element Compounds of carbon are formed with oxygen hydrogen nitrogen sulphur chlorine and many other elements giving rise to compounds with specific properties which depend on the elements other than carbon present in the molecule Again the bonds that carbon forms with most other elements are very strong making these compounds exceptionally stable One reason for the formation of strong bonds by carbon is its small size This enables the nucleus to hold on to the shared pairs of electrons strongly The bonds formed by elements having bigger atoms are much weaker 202425 Carbon and its Compounds 63 Organic compounds The two characteristic features seen in carbon that is tetravalency and catenation put together give rise to a large number of compounds Many have the same noncarbon atom or group of atoms attached to different carbon chains These compounds were initially extracted from natural
