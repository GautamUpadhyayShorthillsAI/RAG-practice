to the storage organs of roots fruits and seeds and to growing organs The translocation of food and other substances takes place in the sieve tubes with the help of adjacent companion cells both in upward and downward directions Unlike transport in xylem which can be largely explained by simple physical forces the translocation in phloem is achieved by utilising Figure 512 Figure 512 Figure 512 Figure 512 Figure 512 Movement of water during transpiration in a tree 202425 Science 96 energy Material like sucrose is transferred into phloem tissue using energy from ATP This increases the osmotic pressure of the tissue causing water to move into it This pressure moves the material in the phloem to tissues which have less pressure This allows the phloem to move material according to the plants needs For example in the spring sugar stored in root or stem tissue would be transported to the buds which need energy to grow Q U E S T I O N S 1 What are the components of the transport system in
