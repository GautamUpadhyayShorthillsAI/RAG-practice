are highly compressible as compared to solids and liquids The liquefied petroleum gas LPG cylinder that we get in our home for cooking or the oxygen supplied to hospitals in cylinders is compressed gas Compressed natural gas CNG is used as fuel these days in vehicles Due to its high compressibility large volumes of a gas can be compressed into a small cylinder and transported easily We come to know of what is being cooked in the kitchen without even entering there by the smell that reaches our nostrils How does this smell reach us The particles of the aroma of food mix with the particles of air spread from the kitchen reach us and even farther away The smell of hot cooked food reaches us in seconds compare this with the rate of diffusion of solids and liquids Due to high speed of particles and large space between them gases show the property of diffusing very fast into other gases In the gaseous state the particles move about randomly at high speed Due to this random movement the
