using special molecules on their surfaces then they would be able to recognise information and even transmit it This will be slower of course but it can potentially reach all cells of the body regardless of nervous connections and it can be done steadily and persistently These compounds or hormones used by multicellular organisms for control and coordination show a great deal of diversity as we would expect Different plant hormones help to coordinate growth development and responses to the environment They are synthesised at places away from where they act and simply diffuse to the area of action Let us take an example that we have worked with earlier Activity 62 When growing plants detect light a hormone called auxin synthesised at the shoot tip helps the cells to grow longer When light is coming from one side of the plant auxin diffuses towards the shady side of the shoot This concentration of auxin stimulates the cells to grow longer on the side of the shoot which is away from
