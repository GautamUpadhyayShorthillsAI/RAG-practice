atom 421 THOMSONS MODEL OF AN ATOM Thomson proposed the model of an atom to be similar to that of a Christmas pudding The electrons in a sphere of positive charge were like currants dry fruits in a spherical Christmas pudding We can also think of a watermelon the positive charge in the atom is spread all over like the red edible part of the watermelon while the electrons are studded in the positively charged sphere like the seeds in the watermelon Fig 41 Thomson proposed that i An atom consists of a positively charged sphere and the electrons are embedded in it ii The negative and positive charges are equal in magnitude So the atom as a whole is electrically neutral Although Thomsons model explained that atoms are electrically neutral the results of experiments carried out by other scientists could not be explained by this model as we will see below 422 RUTHERFORDS MODEL OF AN ATOM Ernest Rutherford was interested in knowing how the electrons are arranged within an atom Rutherford
