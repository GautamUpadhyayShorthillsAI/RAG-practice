this be achieved If the body design in the squirrel relied only on electrical impulses via nerve cells the range of tissues instructed to prepare for the coming activity would be limited On the other hand if a chemical signal were to be sent as well it would reach all cells of the body and provide the wide ranging changes needed This is done in many animals including human beings using a hormone called adrenaline that is secreted from the adrenal glands Look at Fig 67 to locate these glands Adrenaline is secreted directly into the blood and carried to different parts of the body The target organs or the specific tissues on which it acts include the heart As a result the heart beats faster resulting in supply of more oxygen to our muscles The blood to the digestive system and skin is reduced due to contraction of muscles around small arteries in these organs This diverts the blood to our skeletal muscles The breathing rate also increases because of the contractions of the diaphragm and
