Fig 48 Interaction between two bar magnets a b Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 6 68 Repeat the activity by using an iron bar in place of one of the magnets What do you observe this time You will find that both the ends of the iron bar will be attracted by both the North and South poles of the magnet From this activity we find that a magnet can be identified by its property of repulsion Activity 46 Let us experiment Take a magnetic compass and a bar magnet Place the magnetic compass over a horizontal surface and wait for its needle to come to rest Now slowly bring North pole of the bar magnet close to the North pole of the compass needle as shown in Fig 49a Observe the compass needle carefully What do you observe Does the needle deflect If yes in which direction Now repeat the above step with the South pole of the bar magnet Do you observe any difference this time b a Fig 49 A compass needle and a magnet The compass needle is also a magnet Will it show the same behaviour if a
