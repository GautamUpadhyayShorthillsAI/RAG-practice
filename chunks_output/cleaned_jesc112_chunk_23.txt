of your left hand such that they are mutually perpendicular Fig 1213 If the first finger points in the direction of magnetic field and the second finger in the direction of current then the thumb will point in the direction of motion or the force acting on the conductor Devices that use currentcarrying conductors and magnetic fields include electric motor electric generator loudspeakers microphones and measuring instruments Example 122 An electron enters a magnetic field at right angles to it as shown in Fig 1214 The direction of force acting on the electron will be a to the right b to the left c out of the page d into the page Solution Answer is option d The direction of force is perpendicular to the direction of magnetic field and current as given by Flemings left hand rule Recall that the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction of motion of electrons The force is therefore directed into the page Figure 1213 Figure 1213 Figure 1213 Figure 1213 Figure 1213 Flemings
