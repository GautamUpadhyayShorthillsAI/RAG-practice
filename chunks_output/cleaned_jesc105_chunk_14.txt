is essential for photosynthesis So far we have talked about how autotrophs meet their energy requirements But they also need other raw materials for building their body Water used in photosynthesis is taken up from the soil by the roots in terrestrial plants Other materials like nitrogen phosphorus iron and magnesium are taken up from the soil Nitrogen is an essential element used in the synthesis of proteins and other compounds This is Figure 54 Experimental setup a with potassium hydroxide b without potassium hydroxide a b 202425 Science 84 taken up in the form of inorganic nitrates or nitrites Or it is taken up as organic compounds which have been prepared by bacteria from atmospheric nitrogen 522 Heterotrophic Nutrition Each organism is adapted to its environment The form of nutrition differs depending on the type and availability of food material as well as how it is obtained by the organism For example whether the food source is stationary such as grass or mobile such as a deer
