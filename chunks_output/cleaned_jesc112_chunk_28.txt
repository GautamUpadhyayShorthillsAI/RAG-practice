they are connected parallel to each other Electric fuse is an important component of all domestic circuits We have already studied the principle and working of a fuse in the previous chapter see Section 117 A fuse in a circuit prevents damage to the appliances and the circuit due to overloading Overloading can occur when the live wire and the neutral wire come into direct contact This occurs when the insulation of wires is damaged or there is a fault in the appliance In such a situation the current in the circuit abruptly increases This is called shortcircuiting The use of an electric fuse prevents the electric circuit and the appliance from a possible damage by stopping the flow of unduly high electric current The Joule heating that takes place in the fuse melts it to break the electric circuit Overloading can also occur due to an accidental hike in the supply voltage Sometimes overloading is caused by connecting too many appliances to a single socket 1 Name two safety measures
