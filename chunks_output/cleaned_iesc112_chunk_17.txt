crop rotation as discussed below in 1212iii These cropping systems are beneficial in insect pest and wheat control besides providing nutrients 1212 ii IRRIGATION Most agriculture in India is rainfed that is the success of crops in most areas is dependent on timely monsoons and sufficient rainfall spread through most of the growing season Hence poor monsoons cause crop failure Ensuring that the crops get water at the right stages during their growing season can increase the expected yields of any crop Therefore many measures are used to bring more and more agricultural land under irrigation Q More to know Droughts occur because of scarcity or irregular distribution of rains Drought poses a threat to rainfed farming areas where farmers do not use irrigation for crop production and depend only on rain Light soils have less water retention capacity In areas with light soils crops get adversely affected by drought conditions Scientists have developed some crop varieties which can tolerate
