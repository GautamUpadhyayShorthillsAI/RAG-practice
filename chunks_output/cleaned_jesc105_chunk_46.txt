helps in the absorption and upward movement of water and minerals dissolved in it from roots to the leaves It also helps in temperature regulation The effect of root pressure in transport of water is more important at night During the day when the stomata are open the transpiration pull becomes the major driving force in the movement of water in the xylem Transport of food and other substances So far we have discussed the transport of water and minerals in plants Now let us consider how the products of metabolic processes particularly photosynthesis are moved from leaves where they are formed to other parts of the plant This transport of soluble products of photosynthesis is called translocation and it occurs in the part of the vascular tissue known as phloem Besides the products of photosynthesis the phloem transports amino acids and other substances These substances are especially delivered to the storage organs of roots fruits and seeds and to growing organs The translocation of
