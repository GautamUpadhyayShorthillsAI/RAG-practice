Refining Electrolytic Refining Electrolytic Refining Electrolytic Refining Many metals such as copper zinc tin nickel silver gold etc are refined electrolytically In this process the impure metal is made the anode and a thin strip of pure metal is made the cathode A solution of the metal salt is used as an electrolyte The apparatus is set up as shown in Fig 312 On passing the current through the electrolyte the pure metal from the anode dissolves into the electrolyte An equivalent amount of pure Figure 311 Figure 311 Figure 311 Figure 311 Figure 311 Thermit process for joining railway tracks Figure 312 Figure 312 Figure 312 Figure 312 Figure 312 Electrolytic refining of copper The electrolyte is a solution of acidified copper sulphate The anode is impure copper whereas the cathode is a strip of pure copper On passing electric current pure copper is deposited on the cathode 202425 Metals and Nonmetals 53 metal from the electrolyte is deposited on the cathode The soluble impurities go
