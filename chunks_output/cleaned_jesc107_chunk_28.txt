and we have seen that plants develop special cell and tissue types to create them Human beings also develop special tissues for this purpose However while the body of the individual organism is growing to its adult size the resources of the body are mainly directed at achieving this growth While that is happening the maturation of the reproductive tissue is not likely to be a major priority Thus as the rate of general body growth begins to slow down reproductive tissues begin to mature This period during adolescence is called puberty So how do all the changes that we have talked about link to the reproductive process We must remember that the sexual mode of reproduction means that germcells from two individuals have to join together This can happen by the external release of germcells from the bodies of individuals as happens in flowering plants Or it can happen by two individuals joining their bodies together for internal transfer of germcells for fusion as happens in many animals If
