depends on the number of H ions and OH ions produced respectively If we take hydrochloric acid and acetic acid of the same concentration say one molar then these produce different amounts of hydrogen ions Acids that give rise to more H ions are said to be strong acids and acids that give less H ions are said to be weak acids Can you now say what weak and strong bases are 231 Impor 231 Impor 231 Impor 231 Impor 231 Importance of pH in Ever tance of pH in Ever tance of pH in Ever tance of pH in Ever tance of pH in Everyday Life yday Life yday Life yday Life yday Life Are plants and animals pH sensitive Our body works within the pH range of 70 to 78 Living organisms can survive only in a narrow range of pH change When pH of rain water is less than 56 it is called acid rain When acid rain flows into the rivers it lowers the pH of the river water The survival of aquatic life in such rivers becomes difficult Table 22 S Solution Colour of Approx Nature of No pH paper imate substance pH value
