If it is prevented from growing it will not show any movement So plants show two different types of movement one dependent on growth and the other independent of growth 621 Immediate Response to Stimulus Let us think about the first kind of movement such as that of the sensitive plant Since no growth is involved the plant must actually move its leaves in response to touch But there is no nervous tissue nor any muscle tissue How does the plant detect the touch and how do the leaves move in response Figure 64 Figure 64 Figure 64 Figure 64 Figure 64 The sensitive plant If we think about where exactly the plant is touched and what part of the plant actually moves it is apparent that movement happens at a point different from the point of touch So information that a touch has occurred must be communicated The plants also use electricalchemical means to convey this information from cell to cell but unlike in animals there is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information
