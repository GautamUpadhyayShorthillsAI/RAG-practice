both the male and the female reproductive parts The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametes are found in the ovule Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther of one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower Pollination is of two types selfpollination and crosspollination In selfpollination pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the stigma of the same flower In crosspollination pollen grains are transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind water and insects The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation Fertilised egg is called zygote Zygote develops into an embryo Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed which contains the developing embryo Seed dispersal is aided by wind water and animals Seed dispersal helps the plants to i prevent overcrowding ii avoid competition for
