happen in the case of a diatomic molecule of nitrogen Nitrogen has the atomic number 7 What would be its electronic configuration and its combining capacity In order to attain an octet each nitrogen atom in a molecule of nitrogen contributes three electrons giving rise to three shared pairs of electrons This is said to constitute a triple bond between the two atoms The electron dot structure of N2 and its triple bond can be depicted as in Fig 44 A molecule of ammonia has the formula NH3 Can you draw the electron dot structure for this molecule showing how all four atoms achieve noble gas configuration Will the molecule have single double or triple bonds Let us now take a look at methane which is a compound of carbon Methane is widely used as a fuel and is a major component of biogas and Compressed Natural Gas CNG It is also one of the simplest compounds formed by carbon Methane has a formula CH4 Hydrogen as you know has a valency of 1 Carbon is tetravalent because it has four valence
