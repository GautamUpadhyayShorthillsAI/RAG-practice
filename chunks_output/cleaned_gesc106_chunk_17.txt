organisms It releases energy from the food The oxygen we inhale is used to breakdown glucose into carbon dioxide and water Energy is released in the process The breakdown of glucose occurs in the cells of an organism cellular respiration If the food is broken down with the use of oxygen it is called aerobic respiration If the breakdown occurs without the use of oxygen the respiration is called anaerobic respiration During heavy exercise when the supply of oxygen to our muscle cells is insufficient food breakdown is by anaerobic respiration Breathing is a part of the process of respiration during which an organism takes in the oxygenrich air and gives out air rich in carbon dioxide The respiratory organs for the exchange of gases vary in different organisms During inhalation our lungs expand and then come back to the original state as the air moves out during exhalation Increased physical activity enhances the rate of breathing In animals like cow buffalo dog and cat the respiratory
