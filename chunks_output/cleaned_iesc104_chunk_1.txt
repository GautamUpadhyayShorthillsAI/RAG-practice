In Chapter 3 we have learnt that atoms and molecules are the fundamental building blocks of matter The existence of different kinds of matter is due to different atoms constituting them Now the questions arise i What makes the atom of one element different from the atom of another element and ii Are atoms really indivisible as proposed by Dalton or are there smaller constituents inside the atom We shall find out the answers to these questions in this chapter We will learn about subatomic particles and the various models that have been proposed to explain how these particles are arranged within the atom A major challenge before the scientists at the end of the 19th century was to reveal the structure of the atom as well as to explain its important properties The elucidation of the structure of atoms is based on a series of experiments One of the first indications that atoms are not indivisible comes from studying static electricity and the condition under which electricity is conducted
