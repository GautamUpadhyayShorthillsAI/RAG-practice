like the root stem and leaves develop into new plants under appropriate conditions Unlike in most animals plants can indeed use such a mode for reproduction This property of vegetative propagation is used in methods such as layering or grafting to grow many plants like sugarcane roses or grapes for agricultural purposes Plants raised by vegetative propagation can bear flowers and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds Such methods also make possible the propagation of plants such as banana orange rose and jasmine that have lost the capacity to produce seeds Another advantage of vegetative propagation is that all plants produced are genetically similar enough to the parent plant to have all its characteristics 202425 Science 118 Similarly buds produced in the notches along the leaf margin of Bryophyllum fall on the soil and develop into new plants Fig 75 Activity 76 Activity 76 Activity 76 Activity 76 Activity 76 n Select a moneyplant n Cut some pieces such that they contain at
