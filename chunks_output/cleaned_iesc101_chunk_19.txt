heat the beaker that is we continue to supply heat This heat gets used up in changing the state by overcoming the forces of attraction between the particles As this heat energy is absorbed by ice without showing any rise in temperature it is considered that it gets hidden into the contents of the beaker and is known as the latent heat The word latent means hidden The amount of heat energy that is required to change 1 kg of a solid into liquid at atmospheric pressure at its melting point is known as the latent heat of fusion So particles in water at 0oC 273 K have more energy as compared to particles in ice at the same temperature When we supply heat energy to water particles start moving even faster At a certain temperature a point is reached when the particles have enough energy to break free from the forces of attraction of each other At this temperature the liquid starts changing into gas The temperature at which a liquid starts boiling at the atmospheric pressure is known as its
