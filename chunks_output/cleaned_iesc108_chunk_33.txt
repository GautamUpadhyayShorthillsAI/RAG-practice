friction force that will be exerted on the cabinet 11 According to the third law of motion when we push on an object the object pushes back on us with an equal and opposite force If the object is a massive truck parked along the roadside it will probably not move A student justifies this by answering that the two opposite and equal forces cancel each other Comment on this logic and explain why the truck does not move 12 A hockey ball of mass 200 g travelling at 10 m s1 is struck by a hockey stick so as to return it along its original path with a velocity at 5 m s1 Calculate the magnitude of change of momentum occurred in the motion of the hockey ball by the force applied by the hockey stick 13 A bullet of mass 10 g travelling horizontally with a velocity of 150 m s1 strikes a stationary wooden block and comes to rest in 003 s Calculate the distance of penetration of the bullet into the block Also calculate the magnitude of the force exerted by the wooden block on the bullet 14 An
