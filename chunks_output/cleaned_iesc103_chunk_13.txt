as whole numbers However in 1961 for a universally accepted atomic mass unit carbon12 isotope was chosen as the standard reference for measuring atomic masses One atomic mass unit is a mass unit equal to exactly onetwelfth 112th the mass of one atom of carbon12 The relative atomic masses of all elements have been found with respect to an atom of carbon12 Imagine a fruit seller selling fruits without any standard weight with him He takes a watermelon and says this has a mass equal to 12 units 12 watermelon units or 12 fruit mass units He makes twelve equal pieces of the watermelon and finds the mass of each fruit he is selling relative to the mass of one piece of the watermelon Now he sells his fruits by relative fruit mass unit fmu as in Fig 34 Fig 34 a Watermelon b 12 pieces c 112 of watermelon d how the fruit seller can weigh the fruits using pieces of watermelon Similarly the relative atomic mass of the atom of an element is defined as the average mass of the atom as compared to
