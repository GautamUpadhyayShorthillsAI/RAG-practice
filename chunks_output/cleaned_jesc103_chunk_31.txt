can be reduced to metals by heating alone For example cinnabar HgS is an ore of mercury When it is heated in air it is first converted into mercuric oxide HgO Mercuric oxide is then reduced to mercury on further heating 2HgSs 3O g 2HgOs 2SO g 2 2 Heat 2HgOs 2Hgl O g 2 Heat Similarly copper which is found as Cu2S in nature can be obtained from its ore by just heating in air 2Cu S 3O g 2Cu Os 2SO g 2Cu O Cu S 2 2 2 2 2 2 Heat Heat 6Cus SO g 2 344 Extracting Metals in the Middle of the Activity Series The metals in the middle of the activity series such as iron zinc lead copper are moderately reactive These are usually present as sulphides or carbonates in nature It is easier to obtain a metal from its oxide as compared to its sulphides and carbonates Therefore prior to reduction the metal sulphides and carbonates must be converted into metal oxides The sulphide ores are converted into oxides by heating strongly in the presence of excess air This process is known as roasting The
