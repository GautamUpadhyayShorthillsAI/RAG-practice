odour of burning sulphur 2FeSO4s Heat Fe2O3s SO2g SO3g 119 Ferrous sulphate Ferric oxide In this reaction you can observe that a single reactant breaks down to give simpler products This is a decomposition reaction Ferrous sulphate crystals FeSO4 7H2O lose water when heated and the colour of the crystals changes It then decomposes to ferric oxide Fe2O3 sulphur dioxide SO2 and sulphur trioxide SO3 Ferric oxide is a solid while SO2 and SO3 are gases Decomposition of calcium carbonate to calcium oxide and carbon dioxide on heating is an important decomposition reaction used in various industries Calcium oxide is called lime or quick lime It has many uses one is in the manufacture of cement When a decomposition reaction is carried out by heating it is called thermal decomposition CaCO3s Heat CaOs CO2g 120 Limestone Quick lime Another example of a thermal decomposition reaction is given in Activity 16 122 Decomposition Reaction 202425 Chemical Reactions and Equations 99999 Activity 17
