the battery Compare the two values n Take out the plug key and disconnect the voltmeter Now insert the voltmeter across the ends X and P of the first resistor as shown in Fig 118 Figure 118 Figure 118 Figure 118 Figure 118 Figure 118 n Plug the key and measure the potential difference across the first resistor Let it be V1 n Similarly measure the potential difference across the other two resistors separately Let these values be V2 and V3 respectively n Deduce a relationship between V V1 V2 and V3 You will observe that the potential difference V is equal to the sum of potential differences V1 V2 and V3 That is the total potential difference across a combination of resistors in series is equal to the sum of potential difference across the individual resistors That is V V1 V2 V3 1111 In the electric circuit shown in Fig 118 let I be the current through the circuit The current through each resistor is also I It is possible to replace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent
