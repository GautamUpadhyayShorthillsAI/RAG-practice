81 Momentum has both direction and magnitude Its direction is the same as that of velocity v The SI unit of momentum is kilogrammetre per second kg m s1 Since the application of an unbalanced force brings a change in the velocity of the object it is therefore clear that a force also produces a change of momentum Let us consider a situation in which a car with a dead battery is to be pushed along a straight road to give it a speed of 1 m s1 which is sufficient to start its engine If one or two persons give a sudden push unbalanced force to it it hardly starts But a continuous push over some time results in a gradual acceleration of the car to this speed It means that the change of momentum of the car is not only determined by the magnitude of the force but also by the time during which the force is exerted It may then also be concluded that the force necessary to change the momentum of an object depends on the time rate at which the momentum is changed The second law of motion states
