graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis 3 What can you say about the motion of an object if its speed time graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis 202425 SCIENCE 82 Example 77 The brakes applied to a car produce an acceleration of 6 m s2 in the opposite direction to the motion If the car takes 2 s to stop after the application of brakes calculate the distance it travels during this time Solution We have been given a 6 m s2 t 2 s and v 0 m s1 From Eq 75 we know that v u at 0 u 6 m s2 2 s or u 12 m s1 From Eq 76 we get s u t 1 2 a t 2 12 m s1 2 s 1 2 6 m s2 2 s2 24 m 12 m 12 m Thus the car will move 12 m before it stops after the application of brakes Can you now appreciate why drivers are cautioned to maintain some distance between vehicles while travelling on the road uestions 1 A bus starting from rest moves with a uniform acceleration of 01 m s2 for 2 minutes Find a the speed acquired b the distance travelled 2 A train is travelling at a speed of 90 km h1
