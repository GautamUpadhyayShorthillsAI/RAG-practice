red light has a wavelength about 18 times greater than blue light Thus when sunlight passes through the atmosphere the fine particles in air scatter the blue colour shorter wavelengths more strongly than red The scattered blue light enters our eyes If the earth had no atmosphere there would not have been any scattering Then the sky would have looked dark The sky appears dark to passengers flying at very high altitudes as scattering is not prominent at such heights You might have observed that danger signal lights are red in colour Do you know why The red is least scattered by fog or smoke Therefore it can be seen in the same colour at a distance 202425 Science 170 What you have learnt n The ability of the eye to focus on both near and distant objects by adjusting its focal length is called the accommodation of the eye n The smallest distance at which the eye can see objects clearly without strain is called the near point of the eye or the least distance of distinct vision For a young
