under the velocitytime graph gives the distance magnitude of displacement moved by the car in a given interval of time If the car would have been moving with uniform velocity the distance travelled by it would be represented by the area ABCD under the graph Fig 76 Since the magnitude of the velocity of the car is changing due to acceleration the distance s travelled by the car will be given by the area ABCDE under the velocitytime graph Fig 76 That is s area ABCDE area of the rectangle ABCD area of the triangle ADE AB BC 1 2 AD DE In the case of nonuniformly accelerated motion velocitytime graphs can have any shape Fig 77 Velocitytime graphs of an object in non uniformly accelerated motion Fig 77a shows a velocitytime graph that represents the motion of an object whose velocity is decreasing with time while Fig 77 b shows the velocitytime graph representing the nonuniform variation of velocity of the object with time Try to interpret these graphs Activity Activity Activity Activity
