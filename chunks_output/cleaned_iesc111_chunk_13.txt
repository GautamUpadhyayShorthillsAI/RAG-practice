maximum value makes one complete oscillation The number of such oscillations per unit time is the frequency of the sound wave If we can count the number of the compressions or rarefactions that cross us per unit time we will get the frequency of the sound wave It is usually represented by Greek letter nu Its SI unit is hertz symbol Hz The time taken by two consecutive compressions or rarefactions to cross a fixed point is called the time period of the wave In other words we can say that the time taken for one complete oscillation is called the time period of the sound wave It is represented by the symbol T Its SI unit is second s Frequency and time period are related as follows A violin and a flute may both be played at the same time in an orchestra Both sounds travel through the same medium that is air and arrive at our ear at the same time Both sounds travel at the same speed irrespective of the source But the sounds we receive are different This is due to the different
