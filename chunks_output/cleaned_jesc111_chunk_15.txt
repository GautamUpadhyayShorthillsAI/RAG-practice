and find the current through it by measuring the reading of the ammeter n Now repeat the above step with the 10 W bulb in the gap XY n Are the ammeter readings different for different components connected in the gap XY What do the above observations indicate n You may repeat this Activity by keeping any material component in the gap Observe the ammeter readings in each case Analyse the observations Activity 113 Activity 113 Activity 113 Activity 113 Activity 113 n Complete an electric circuit consisting of a cell an ammeter a nichrome wire of length l say marked 1 and a plug key as shown in Fig 115 202425 Science 178 It is observed that the ammeter reading decreases to onehalf when the length of the wire is doubled The ammeter reading is increased when a thicker wire of the same material and of the same length is used in the circuit A change in ammeter reading is observed when a wire of different material of the same length and the same area of crosssection is used On applying Ohms
