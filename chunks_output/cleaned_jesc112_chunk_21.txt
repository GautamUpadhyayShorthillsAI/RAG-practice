observe It is observed that the rod is displaced towards the left You will notice that the rod gets displaced n Reverse the direction of current flowing through the rod and observe the direction of its displacement It is now towards the right Why does the rod get displaced Figure 1212 Figure 1212 Figure 1212 Figure 1212 Figure 1212 A currentcarrying rod AB experiences a force perpendicular to its length and the magnetic field Support for the magnet is not shown here for simplicity The displacement of the rod in the above activity suggests that a force is exerted on the currentcarrying aluminium rod when it is placed in a magnetic field It also suggests that the direction of force is also reversed when the direction of current through the conductor is reversed Now change the direction of field to vertically downwards by interchanging the two poles of the magnet It is once again observed that 202425 Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 203 the direction of force acting on the
