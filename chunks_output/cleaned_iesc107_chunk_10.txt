of an object is obtained by dividing the total distance travelled by the total time taken That is average speed Total distance travelled Total time taken If an object travels a distance s in time t then its speed v is v s t 71 Let us understand this by an example A car travels a distance of 100 km in 2 h Its average speed is 50 km h1 The car might not have travelled at 50 km h1 all the time Sometimes it might have travelled faster and sometimes slower than this Example 71 An object travels 16 m in 4 s and then another 16 m in 2 s What is the average speed of the object Solution Total distance travelled by the object 16 m 16 m 32 m Total time taken 4 s 2 s 6 s Average speed Total distance travelled Total time taken 32 m 6 s 533 m s1 Therefore the average speed of the object is 533 m s1 721 SPEED WITH DIRECTION The rate of motion of an object can be more comprehensive if we specify its direction of motion along with its speed The quantity that specifies both these aspects is called
