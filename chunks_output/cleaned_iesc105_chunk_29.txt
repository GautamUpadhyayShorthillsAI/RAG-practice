in which materials such as starch oils and protein granules are stored The internal organisation of the Chloroplast consists of numerous membrane layers embedded in a material called the stroma These are similar to mitochondria in external structure Like the mitochondria plastids also have their own DNA and ribosomes 525 vi VACUOLES Vacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid contents Vacuoles are small sized in animal cells while plant cells have very large vacuoles The central vacuole of some plant cells may occupy 5090 of the cell volume In plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap and provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell Many substances of importance in the life of the plant cell are stored in vacuoles These include amino acids sugars various organic acids and some proteins In singlecelled organisms like Amoeba the food vacuole contains the food items that the Amoeba has consumed In some unicellular organisms specialised vacuoles also play important roles in expelling
