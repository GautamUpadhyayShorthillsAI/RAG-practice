the patients organs such as the liver gall bladder uterus kidney etc It helps the doctor to detect abnormalities such as stones in the gall bladder and kidney or tumours in different organs In this technique the ultrasonic waves travel through the tissues of the body and get reflected from a region where there is a change of tissue density 202425 SOUND 137 What you have learnt Sound is produced due to vibration of different objects Sound travels as a longitudinal wave through a material medium Sound travels as successive compressions and rarefactions in the medium In sound propagation it is the energy of the sound that travels and not the particles of the medium The change in density from one maximum value to the minimum value and again to the maximum value makes one complete oscillation The distance between two consecutive compressions or two consecutive rarefactions is called the wavelength The time taken by the wave for one complete oscillation of the density or pressure of the
