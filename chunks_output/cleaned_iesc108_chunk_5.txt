is required And the change in its speed or in the direction of motion would continue as long as this unbalanced force is applied However if this force is 81 Balanced and Unbalanced Forces Fig 83 shows a wooden block on a horizontal table Two strings X and Y are tied to the two opposite faces of the block as shown If we apply a force by pulling the string X the block begins to move to the right Similarly if we pull the string Y the block moves to the left But if the block is pulled from both the sides with equal forces the block will not move Such forces are called balanced forces and do not change the state of rest or of motion of an object Now let us consider a situation in which two opposite forces of different magnitudes pull the block In this case the block would begin to move in the direction of the greater force Thus the two forces are not balanced and the unbalanced force acts in the direction the block moves This suggests that an unbalanced force acting on an object brings it
