the ground and are called creepers What can be other features on the basis of which you can group plants Let us perform another activity Activity 25 Let us compare Look at the leaves of different plants collected by you during the nature walk Do you notice the variation in the shape and structure of these leaves You may observe thin lines on the leaves of the plants Fig 24a These are veins The pattern of veins on the leaf is called venation What differences do you see in the veins of leaves shown in Fig 24a and Fig 24b In some leaves you can observe a netlike pattern of veins on both sides of a thick middle vein This pattern is called reticulate venation For example leaves of hibiscus exhibit reticulate venation Fig 24a In some leaves you may observe that the veins run parallel This pattern is called parallel venation For example the leaves of banana plants and grasses exhibit parallel venation Fig 24b and Fig 24c Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 6 18 Do you think that plants can
