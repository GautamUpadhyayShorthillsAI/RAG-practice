a complete map of the earthquake as shown in Fig 1214 They can also estimate its power to cause destruction Fig 1213 A seismograph A typical seismograph record Fig 1214 Map of the earthquake Epicentre Seismic waves Focus Inside the earth Earths Surface Like many other scales in science decibel is another example Richter scale is not linear This means that an earthquake of magnitude 6 does not have one and half times the destructive energy of an earthquake of magnitude 4 In fact an increase of 2 in magnitude means 1000 times more destructive energy Therefore an earthquake of magnitude 6 has thousand times more destructive energy than an earthquake of magnitude 4 Protection against Earthquakes We know from the earlier pages that earthquakes cannot be predicted We have also seen that they can be highly destructive It is therefore important that we take necessary precautions to protect ourselves all the time People living in seismic zones where the earthquakes are more likely to occur
