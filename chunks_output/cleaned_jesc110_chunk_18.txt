of the spectrum to pass through the second prism He found a beam of white light emerging from the other side of the second prism This observation gave Newton the idea that the sunlight is made up of seven colours Any light that gives a spectrum similar to that of sunlight is often referred to as white light A rainbow is a natural spectrum appearing in the sky after a rain shower Fig 107 It is caused by dispersion of sunlight by tiny water droplets present in the atmosphere A rainbow is always formed in a direction opposite to that of the Sun The water droplets act like small prisms They refract and disperse the incident sunlight then reflect it internally and finally refract it again when it comes out of the raindrop Fig 108 Due to the dispersion of light and internal reflection different colours reach the observers eye You can also see a rainbow on a sunny day when you look at the sky through a waterfall or through a water fountain with the Sun behind you Figure 105 Figure 105 Figure
