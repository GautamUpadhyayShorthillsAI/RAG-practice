on the number of valence electrons Let us now look at the electronic configuration of carbon The atomic number of carbon is 6 What would be the distribution of electrons in various shells of carbon How many valence electrons will carbon have We know that the reactivity of elements is explained as their tendency to attain a completely filled outer shell that is attain noble gas configuration Elements forming ionic compounds achieve this by either gaining or losing electrons from the outermost shell In the case of carbon it has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs to gain or lose four electrons to attain noble gas configuration If it were to gain or lose electrons i It could gain four electrons forming C4 anion But it would be difficult for the nucleus with six protons to hold on to ten electrons that is four extra electrons ii It could lose four electrons forming C4 cation But it would require a large amount of energy to remove four electrons leaving behind a carbon cation
