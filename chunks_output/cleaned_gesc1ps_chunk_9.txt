Attempt has been made to recall childrens own experiences and build concepts around them This is designed to connect science that they study in the school with their everyday life Many activities have been suggested to clarify concepts Some of these activities are so simple that children can perform them on their own The requirement of the apparatus required for the activities is minimal We performed all the activities ourselves to ensure that there was no difficulty in performing them in the school situation The activities should also help children in developing skills such as presentation of data in tabular and graphical forms reasoning and drawing inference from the given data The language of the book has been kept as simple as possible A large number of photographs illustrations cartoons etc have been included to make the book attractive To help teachers evaluate children effectively a large number of exercises have been given at the end of each chapter The teachers are encouraged
