of sunlight ignites the paper The distance of this image from the position of the mirror gives the approximate value of focal length of the mirror Let us try to understand this observation with the help of a ray diagram Observe Fig92 a closely A number of rays parallel to the principal axis are falling on a concave mirror Observe the reflected rays They are all meetingintersecting at a point on the principal axis of the mirror This point is called the principal focus of the concave mirror Similarly observe Fig 92 b How are the rays parallel to the principal axis reflected by a convex mirror The reflected rays appear to come from a point on the principal axis This point is called the principal focus of the convex mirror The principal focus is represented by the letter F The distance between the pole and the principal focus of a spherical mirror is called the focal length It is represented by the letter f Figure 92 Figure 92 Figure 92 Figure 92 Figure 92 a Concave mirror b Convex mirror
