motion Activity 54 Let us investigate Tie an eraser or a potato at one end of a thread Hold the other end of the thread with your hand and whirl it Fig 515 Observe its motion Is the motion of the eraser the same as that of a merrygo round When an object moves along a circular path its motion is called circular motion Fig 514 Linear motion When an object moves along a straight line its motion is called linear motion Identify such linear motion in your surroundings Measurement of Length and Motion 93 Activity 55 Let us investigate Tie an eraser or a potato at one end of a thread Hang the eraser by holding the other end of the thread Fig 516 Keep your hand steady Using the other hand take the eraser slightly to one side and then release Fig 516 Does it start moving to and fro Is its motion similar to the motion of a swing When an object moves to and fro about some fixed position its motion is called oscillatory motion Fig 516 Oscillatory motion Fig 515 Circular motion Curiosity Textbook
