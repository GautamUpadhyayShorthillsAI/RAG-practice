to represent the time on the graph For the motion of the car scales could be Time 1 min 1 cm Distance 1 km 1 cm Mark values for the time and the distance on the respective axes according to the scale you have chosen For the motion of the car mark the time 1 min 2 min on the xaxis from the origin O Similarly mark the distance 1 km 2 km on the yaxis Fig 912 Now you have to mark the points on the graph paper to represent each set of values for distance and time Observation recorded at S No 1 in Table 96 shows that at time 0 min the distance moved is also zero The point corresponding to this set of values on the graph will therefore be the origin itself After 1 minute the car has moved a distance of 1 km To mark this set of values look for the point that represents 1 minute on the xaxis Draw a line parallel to the yaxis at this point Then draw a line parallel to the xaxis from the point corresponding to distance 1 km on the yaxis The point where these two lines intersect represents this
