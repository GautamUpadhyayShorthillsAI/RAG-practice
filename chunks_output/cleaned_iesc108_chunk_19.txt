an object depends on the time rate at which the momentum is changed The second law of motion states that the rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of force 841 MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION OF SECOND LAW OF MOTION Suppose an object of mass m is moving along a straight line with an initial velocity u It is uniformly accelerated to velocity v in time t by the application of a constant force F throughout the time t The initial and final momentum of the object will be p1 mu and p2 mv respectively The change in momentum p2 p1 mv mu m v u The rate of change of momentum m v u t Or the applied force F m v u t km v u t F 82 k m a 83 Here a v ut is the acceleration which is the rate of change of velocity The quantity k is a constant of proportionality The SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m s2 respectively The unit of force is so chosen that the value of the constant k becomes one For this one unit of force is defined as
