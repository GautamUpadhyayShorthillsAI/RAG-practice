like in the lungs is a cluster of very thinwalled blood capillaries Each capillary cluster in the kidney is associated with the cupshaped end of a coiled tube called Bowmans capsule that collects the filtrate Fig 514 Each kidney has large numbers of these filtration units called nephrons packed close together Some substances in the initial filtrate such as glucose amino acids salts and a major amount of water are selectively reabsorbed as the urine flows along the tube The amount of water reabsorbed depends on how much excess water there is in the body and on how much of dissolved waste there is to be excreted The urine forming in each kidney eventually enters a long tube the ureter which connects the kidneys with the urinary bladder Urine is stored in the urinary bladder until the pressure of the expanded bladder leads to the urge to pass it out through the urethra The bladder is muscular so it is under nervous control as we have discussed elsewhere As a result we can usually control
