metallic body of the appliance keeps its potential to that of the earth and the user may not get a severe electric shock 2 In Activity 127 how do we think the displacement of rod AB will be affected if i current in rod AB is increased ii a stronger horseshoe magnet is used and iii length of the rod AB is increased 3 A positivelycharged particle alphaparticle projected towards west is deflected towards north by a magnetic field The direction of magnetic field is a towards south b towards east c downward d upward Magnetism in medicine An electric current always produces a magnetic field Even weak ion currents that travel along the nerve cells in our body produce magnetic fields When we touch something our nerves carry an electric impulse to the muscles we need to use This impulse produces a temporary magnetic field These fields are very weak and are about onebillionth of the earths magnetic field Two main organs in the human body where the magnetic field produced is significant are the
