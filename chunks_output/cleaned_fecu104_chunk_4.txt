The materials which are attracted towards a magnet are called magnetic materials The metal iron is a magnetic material Nickel and cobalt are other metals that are also magnetic Some of their combinations with other metals are also attracted towards magnets The materials which are not attracted towards a magnet are called nonmagnetic materials Which materials listed in Table 41 were found to be nonmagnetic 42 Poles of Magnet Activity 42 Let us investigate Spread some iron filings very small pieces of iron on a sheet of paper Place a bar magnet over them Tap the paper and observe carefully what happens to the iron filings Do you observe anything special about the way they stick to the magnet Do the iron filings stick all over the magnet uniformly Or do the iron filings stick more at some places We find that maximum iron filings stick near the ends of the bar magnet as shown in Fig 44 while a very few iron filings stick at the remaining part of the magnet Fig 44 Iron filings sticking to
