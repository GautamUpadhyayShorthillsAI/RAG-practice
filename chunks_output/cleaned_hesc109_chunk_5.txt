Fig 94 The pencil cell covers different distances on different surfaces I shall try the activity by wrapping a piece of sandpaper around the cell Friction is caused by the irregularities on the two surfaces in contact Even those surfaces which appear very smooth have a large number of minute irregularities on them Fig 95 Irregularities on the two surfaces lock into one another When we attempt to move any surface we have to apply a force to overcome interlocking On rough surfaces there are a larger number of irregularities So the force of friction is greater if a rough surface is involved Mark A Mark A Surface of book Surface of table 202425 FRICTION 115 We see that the friction is caused by the interlocking of irregularities in the two surfaces It is obvious that the force of friction will increase if the two surfaces are pressed harder You can experience it by dragging a mat when nobody is sitting on it and when a preson is sitting on it friction and you find it somewhat easier to
