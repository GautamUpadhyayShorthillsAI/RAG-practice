If the children push the box harder still the pushing force becomes bigger than the friction force Fig 84c There is an unbalanced force So the box starts moving What happens when we ride a bicycle When we stop pedalling the bicycle begins to slow down This is again because of the friction forces acting opposite to the direction of motion In order to keep the bicycle moving we have to start pedalling again It thus appears that an object maintains its motion under the continuous application of an unbalanced force However it is quite incorrect An object moves with a uniform velocity when the forces pushing force and frictional force acting on the object are balanced and there is no net external force on it If an unbalanced force is applied on the object there will be a change either in its speed or in the direction of its motion Thus to accelerate the motion of an object an unbalanced force is required And the change in its speed or in the direction of motion would continue as long as
