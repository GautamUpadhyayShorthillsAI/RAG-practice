is encountered when we are standing in a bus and the bus begins to move suddenly Now we tend to fall backwards This is because the sudden start of the bus brings motion to the bus as well as to our feet in contact with the floor of the bus But the rest of our body opposes this motion because of its inertia When a motorcar makes a sharp turn at a high speed we tend to get thrown to one side This can again be explained on the basis of the law of inertia We tend to continue in our straightline motion When an unbalanced force is applied by the engine to change the direction of motion of the motorcar we slip to one side of the seat due to the inertia of our body The fact that a body will remain at rest unless acted upon by an unbalanced force can be illustrated through the following activities Activity 81 Make a pile of similar carom coins on a table as shown in Fig 86 Attempt a sharp horizontal hit at the bottom of the pile using another carom coin or the striker If the hit is strong
