823 How do these Traits get Expressed How does the mechanism of heredity work Cellular DNA is the information source for making proteins in the cell A section of DNA that provides information for one protein is called the gene for that protein How do proteins control the characteristics that we are discussing here Let us take the example of tallness as a characteristic We know that plants have hormones that can trigger growth Plant height can thus depend on the amount of a particular plant hormone The amount of the plant hormone made will depend on the efficiency of the process for making it Consider now an enzyme that is important for this process If this enzyme works efficiently a lot of hormone will be made and the plant will be tall If the gene for that enzyme has an alteration that makes the enzyme less efficient the amount of hormone will be less and the plant will be short Thus genes control characteristics or traits If the interpretations of Mendelian experiments we have been
