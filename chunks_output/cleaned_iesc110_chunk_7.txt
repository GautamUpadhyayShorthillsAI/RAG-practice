Thus work done by a force acting on an object is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance moved in the direction of the force Work has only magnitude and no direction In Eq 101 if F 1 N and s 1 m then the work done by the force will be 1 N m Here the unit of work is newton metre N m or joule J Thus 1 J is the amount of work 202425 WORK AND ENERGY 115 done on an object when a force of 1 N displaces it by 1 m along the line of action of the force Look at Eq 101 carefully What is the work done when the force on the object is zero What would be the work done when the displacement of the object is zero Refer to the conditions that are to be satisfied to say that work is done Example 101 A force of 5 N is acting on an object The object is displaced through 2 m in the direction of the force Fig 102 If the force acts on the object all through the displacement then work done is 5 N 2 m 10 N m or 10 J Fig 104 Consider a situation in which an object is moving with a uniform
