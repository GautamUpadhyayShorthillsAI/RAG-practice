find any change in the value of current through the ammeter 1161 Resistors in Series What happens to the value of current when a number of resistors are connected in series in a circuit What would be their equivalent resistance Let us try to understand these with the help of the following activities Figure 117 shows a combination of resistors in which three resistors are connected together between points X and Y Here the resistors are said to be connected in parallel 202425 Electricity 183 Activity 115 Activity 115 Activity 115 Activity 115 Activity 115 n In Activity 114 insert a voltmeter across the ends X and Y of the series combination of three resistors as shown in Fig 116 n Plug the key in the circuit and note the voltmeter reading It gives the potential difference across the series combination of resistors Let it be V Now measure the potential difference across the two terminals of the battery Compare the two values n Take out the plug key and disconnect the voltmeter Now insert
