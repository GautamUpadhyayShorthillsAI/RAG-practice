meet each other at point C to form a triangle ABC Now on the graph AC denotes the time interval t2 t1 while BC corresponds to the distance s2 s1 We can see from the graph that as the object moves from the point A to B it covers a distance s2 s1 in time t2 t1 The speed v of the object therefore can be represented as 2 1 2 1 s s t t 74 We can also plot the distancetime graph for accelerated motion Table 72 shows the distance travelled by a car in a time interval of two seconds Table 72 Distance travelled by a Table 72 Distance travelled by a Table 72 Distance travelled by a Table 72 Distance travelled by a Table 72 Distance travelled by a car at regular time intervals car at regular time intervals car at regular time intervals car at regular time intervals car at regular time intervals Time in seconds Time in seconds Time in seconds Time in seconds Time in seconds Distance in metres Distance in metres Distance in metres Distance in metres Distance in metres 0 0 2 1 4 4 6 9 8 16 10 25 12
