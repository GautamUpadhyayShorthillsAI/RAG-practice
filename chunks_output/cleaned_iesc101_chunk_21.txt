to the Kelvin scale you have to add 273 to the given temperature So we infer that the state of matter can be changed into another state by changing the temperature We have learnt that substances around us change state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas on application of heat But there 202425 SCIENCE 8 enclosed in a cylinder Will the particles come closer Do you think that increasing or decreasing the pressure can change the state of matter are some that change directly from solid state to gaseous state and vice versa without changing into the liquid state Activity 113 Take some camphor Crush it and put it in a china dish Put an inverted funnel over the china dish Put a cotton plug on the stem of the funnel as shown in Fig 17 atmosphere atm is a unit of measuring pressure exerted by a gas The unit of pressure is Pascal Pa 1 atmosphere 101 105 Pa The pressure of air in atmosphere is called atmospheric pressure The atmospheric pressure at sea level is 1 atmosphere and is taken
