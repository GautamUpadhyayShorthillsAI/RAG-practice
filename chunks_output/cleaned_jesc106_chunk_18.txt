but unlike in animals there is no specialised tissue in plants for the conduction of information Finally again as in animals some cells must change shape in order for movement to happen Instead of the specialised proteins found in animal muscle cells plant cells change shape by changing the amount of water in them resulting in swelling or shrinking and therefore in changing shapes Fig 64 622 Movement Due to Growth Some plants like the pea plant climb up other plants or fences by means of tendrils These tendrils are sensitive to touch When they come in contact with any support the part of the tendril in contact with the object does not grow as rapidly as the part of the tendril away from the object This causes the tendril to circle around the object and thus cling to it More commonly plants respond to stimuli slowly by growing in a particular direction Because this growth is directional it appears as if the plant is moving Let us understand this type of movement with the help of an
