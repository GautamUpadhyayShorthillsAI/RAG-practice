potassium iodide barium chloride or any other salt from the science laboratory n What is the physical state of these salts n Take a small amount of a sample on a metal spatula and heat directly on the flame Fig 37 Repeat with other samples n What did you observe Did the samples impart any colour to the flame Do these compounds melt n Try to dissolve the samples in water petrol and kerosene Are they soluble n Make a circuit as shown in Fig 38 and insert the electrodes into a solution of one salt What did you observe Test the other salt samples too in this manner n What is your inference about the nature of these compounds Figure 37 Figure 37 Figure 37 Figure 37 Figure 37 Heating a salt sample on a spatula Figure 38 Figure 38 Figure 38 Figure 38 Figure 38 Testing the conductivity of a salt solution Table 34 Melting and boiling points of some ionic compounds Ionic Melting point Boiling point compound K K NaCl 1074 1686 LiCl 887 1600 CaCl2 1045 1900 CaO 2850 3120 MgCl2 981 1685 202425
