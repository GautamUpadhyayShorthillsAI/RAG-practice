mirror after reflection will emerge parallel to the principal axis This is illustrated in Fig94 a and b iii A ray passing through the centre of curvature of a concave mirror or directed in the direction of the centre of curvature of a convex mirror after reflection is reflected back along the same path This is illustrated in Fig95 a and b The light rays come back along the same path because the incident rays fall on the mirror along the normal to the reflecting surface iv A ray incident obliquely to the principal axis towards a point P pole of the mirror on the concave mirror Fig 96 a or a convex mirror Fig 96 b is reflected obliquely The incident and reflected rays follow the laws of reflection at the point of incidence point P making equal angles with the principal axis a b Figure 94 Figure 94 Figure 94 Figure 94 Figure 94 Remember that in all the above cases the laws of reflection are followed At the point of incidence the incident ray is reflected in such a way that the angle of
