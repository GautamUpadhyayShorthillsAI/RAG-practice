the effect of a base is nullified by an acid and viceversa The reaction taking place is written as NaOHaq HClaq NaClaq H2Ol The reaction between an acid and a base to give a salt and water is known as a neutralisation reaction In general a neutralisation reaction can be written as Base Acid Salt Water 215 Reaction of Metallic Oxides with Acids Activity 27 Activity 27 Activity 27 Activity 27 Activity 27 n Take a small amount of copper oxide in a beaker and add dilute hydrochloric acid slowly while stirring n Note the colour of the solution What has happened to the copper oxide You will notice that the colour of the solution becomes bluegreen and the copper oxide dissolves The bluegreen colour of the solution is due to the formation of copperII chloride in the reaction The general reaction between a metal oxide and an acid can be written as Metal oxide Acid Salt Water Metal carbonateMetal hydrogencarbonate Acid Salt Carbon dioxide Water 214 How do Acids and Bases React with each other
