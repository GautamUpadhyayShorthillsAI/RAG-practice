to the particles of matter during the change of states How does this change of state take place We need answers to these questions isnt it Q a b Fig 16 a Conversion of ice to water b conversion of water to water vapour 202425 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 7 Start heating the beaker on a low flame Note the temperature when the ice starts melting Note the temperature when all the ice has converted into water Record your observations for this conversion of solid to liquid state Now put a glass rod in the beaker and heat while stirring till the water starts boiling Keep a careful eye on the thermometer reading till most of the water has vaporised Record your observations for the conversion of water in the liquid state to the gaseous state On increasing the temperature of solids the kinetic energy of the particles increases Due to the increase in kinetic energy the particles start vibrating with greater speed The energy supplied by heat overcomes the forces of attraction between the particles
