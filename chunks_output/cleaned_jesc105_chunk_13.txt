the same size n Keep them in a dark room for three days n Now place each plant on separate glass plates Place a watchglass containing potassium hydroxide by the side of one of the plants The potassium hydroxide is used to absorb carbon dioxide n Cover both plants with separate belljars as shown in Fig 54 n Use vaseline to seal the bottom of the jars to the glass plates so that the setup is airtight n Keep the plants in sunlight for about two hours n Pluck a leaf from each plant and check for the presence of starch as in the above activity n Do both the leaves show the presence of the same amount of starch n What can you conclude from this activity Figure 53 Figure 53 Figure 53 Figure 53 Figure 53 a Open and b closed stomatal pore Activity 52 Activity 52 Activity 52 Activity 52 Activity 52 Based on the two activities performed above can we design an experiment to demonstrate that sunlight is essential for photosynthesis So far we have talked about how autotrophs meet their energy
