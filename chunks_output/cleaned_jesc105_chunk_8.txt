substances needed in the body This source of energy and materials is the food we eat How do living things get their food The general requirement for energy and materials is common in all organisms but it is fulfilled in different ways Some organisms use simple food material obtained from inorganic sources in the form of carbon dioxide and water These organisms the autotrophs include green plants and some bacteria Other organisms utilise complex substances These complex substances have to be broken down into simpler ones before they can be used for the upkeep and growth of the body To achieve this organisms use biocatalysts called enzymes Thus the heterotrophs survival depends directly or indirectly on autotrophs Heterotrophic organisms include animals and fungi 521 Autotrophic Nutrition Carbon and energy requirements of the autotrophic organism are fulfilled by photosynthesis It is the process by which autotrophs take in substances from the outside and convert them into stored forms
