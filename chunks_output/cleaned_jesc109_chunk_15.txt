an arbitrarily large number of rays emanating from a point could be considered However it is more convenient to consider only two rays for the sake of clarity of the ray diagram These rays are so chosen that it is easy to know their directions after reflection from the mirror The intersection of at least two reflected rays give the position of image of the point object Any two of the following rays can be considered for locating the image i A ray parallel to the principal axis after reflection will pass through the principal focus in case of a concave mirror or appear to diverge from the principal focus in case of a convex mirror This is illustrated in Fig93 a and b a b Figure Figure Figure Figure Figure 93 93 93 93 93 202425 Light Reflection and Refraction 139 ii A ray passing through the principal focus of a concave mirror or a ray which is directed towards the principal focus of a convex mirror after reflection will emerge parallel to the principal axis This is illustrated in Fig94
