motion it moves along the circular path again and again An object in oscillatory motion also repeats its motion while moving to and fro Both circular and oscillatory motion are periodic in nature More to know Measurement of Length and Motion 95 Fig 518 Types of motion observed in a childrens park Table 54 Types of Motion Object Linear motion Circular motion Oscillatory motion Swing Moving to and fro Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 6 96 The International System of Units SI units has been adopted by countries as standard units of measurement The SI unit of length is metre Its symbol is m 1 km 1000 m 1 m 100 cm 1 cm 10 mm When distance is stated with respect to a fixed object or point then this point is called a reference point An object is said to be in motion if its position changes with respect to a reference point with time When an object moves along a straight line its motion is called linear motion When an object moves along a circular path its motion is called circular motion
