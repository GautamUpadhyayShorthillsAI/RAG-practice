by a different process called meiosis which involves two consecutive divisions When a cell divides by meiosis it produces four new cells instead of just two Fig 58 The new cells only have half the number of chromosomes than that of the mother cells Can you think as to why the chromosome number has reduced to half in daughter cells 202425 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE 59 Chromoplasts that contain chlorophyll are called chloroplasts and they perform photosynthesis The primary function of leucoplasts is storage Most mature plant cells have a large central vacuole that helps to maintain the turgidity of the cell and stores important substances including wastes Prokaryotic cells have no membranebound organelles their chromosomes are composed of only nucleic acid and they have only very small ribosomes as organelles Cells in organisms divide for growth of body for repalcing dead cells and for forming gametes for reproduction Exercises 1 Make a comparison and write down ways in which plant
