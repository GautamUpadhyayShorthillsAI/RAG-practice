a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower temperature There are three ways in which heat can flow from one object to another These are conduction convection and radiation In solids generally the heat is transferred by conduction In liquids and gases the heat is transferred by convection No medium is required for transfer of heat by radiation The materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are conductors of heat The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are called insulators Darkcoloured objects absorb more heat than the lightcoloured objects That is the reason we feel more comfortable in lightcoloured clothes in the summer Woollen clothes keep us warm during winter It is so because wool is a poor conductor of heat and it has air trapped in between the fibres Exercises 1 State similarities and differences between the laboratory thermometer and the clinical thermometer 2 Give two examples each of conductors and insulators of heat 3 Fill in
