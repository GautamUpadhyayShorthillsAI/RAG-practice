reaction 53 g of sodium carbonate reacted with 6 g of acetic acid The products were 22 g of carbon dioxide 09 g water and 82 g of sodium acetate Show that these Q John Dalton 202425 SCIENCE 28 We might think that if atoms are so insignificant in size why should we care about them This is because our entire world is made up of atoms We may not be able to see them but they are there and constantly affecting whatever we do Through modern techniques we can now produce magnified images of surfaces of elements showing atoms observations are in agreement with the law of conservation of mass sodium carbonate acetic acid sodium acetate carbon dioxide water 2 Hydrogen and oxygen combine in the ratio of 18 by mass to form water What mass of oxygen gas would be required to react completely with 3 g of hydrogen gas 3 Which postulate of Daltons atomic theory is the result of the law of conservation of mass 4 Which postulate of Daltons atomic theory can explain the law of definite proportions 32
