to provide energy for various life processes Diverse organisms do this in different ways some use oxygen to breakdown glucose completely into carbon dioxide and water some use other pathways that do not involve oxygen Fig 58 In all cases the first step is the breakdown of glucose a sixcarbon molecule into a threecarbon molecule called pyruvate This process takes place in the cytoplasm Further the pyruvate may be converted into ethanol and carbon dioxide This process takes place in yeast during fermentation Since this process takes place in the absence of air oxygen it is called anaerobic respiration Break down of pyruvate using oxygen takes place in the mitochondria This Figure 57 Figure 57 Figure 57 Figure 57 Figure 57 a Air being passed into lime water with a pichkari syringe b air being exhaled into lime water 202425 Science 88 process breaks up the threecarbon pyruvate molecule to give three molecules of carbon dioxide The other product is water Since this process takes place in
