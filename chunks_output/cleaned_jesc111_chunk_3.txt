was first observed So electric current was considered to be the flow of positive charges and the direction of flow of positive charges was taken to be the direction of electric current Conventionally in an electric circuit the direction of electric current is taken as opposite to the direction of the flow of electrons which are negative charges 202425 Science 172 If a net charge Q flows across any crosssection of a conductor in time t then the current I through the crosssection is I Q t 111 The SI unit of electric charge is coulomb C which is equivalent to the charge contained in nearly 6 1018 electrons We know that an electron possesses a negative charge of 16 1019 C The electric current is expressed by a unit called ampere A named after the French scientist AndreMarie Ampere 17751836 One ampere is constituted by the flow of one coulomb of charge per second that is 1 A 1 C1 s Small quantities of current are expressed in milliampere 1 mA 103 A or in microampere 1 A 106 A An instrument
