The natural tendency of objects to resist a change in their state of rest or of uniform motion is called inertia The mass of an object is a measure of its inertia Its SI unit is kilogram kg Force of friction always opposes motion of objects Second law of motion The rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of the force Activity 84 Request two children to stand on two separate carts as shown in Fig 813 Give them a bag full of sand or some other heavy object Ask them to play a game of catch with the bag Does each of them experience an instantaneous force as a result of throwing the sand bag You can paint a white line on cartwheels to observe the motion of the two carts when the children throw the bag towards each other Fig 812 As the sailor jumps in forward direction the boat moves backwards Fig 813 Now place two children on one cart and one on another cart The second law of motion can be seen as this arrangement would show
