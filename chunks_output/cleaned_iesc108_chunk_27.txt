B is equal but opposite in direction to the force exerted by the balance B on balance A Any of these two forces can be called as action and the other as reaction This gives us an alternative statement of the third law of motion ie to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction However it must be remembered that the action and reaction always act on two different objects simultaneously Fig 810 Action and reaction forces are equal and opposite Suppose you are standing at rest and intend to start walking on a road You must accelerate and this requires a force in accordance with the second law of motion Which is this force Is it the muscular effort you exert on the road Is it in the direction we intend to move No you push the road below backwards The road exerts an equal and opposite force on your feet to make you move forward It is important to note that even though the action and reaction forces are always equal in magnitude these forces may not produce accelerations of equal
