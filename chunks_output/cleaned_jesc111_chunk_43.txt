motor takes 5 A from a 220 V line Determine the power of the motor and the energy consumed in 2 h What you have learnt n A stream of electrons moving through a conductor constitutes an electric current Conventionally the direction of current is taken opposite to the direction of flow of electrons n The SI unit of electric current is ampere n To set the electrons in motion in an electric circuit we use a cell or a battery A cell generates a potential difference across its terminals It is measured in volts V n Resistance is a property that resists the flow of electrons in a conductor It controls the magnitude of the current The SI unit of resistance is ohm n Ohms law The potential difference across the ends of a resistor is directly proportional to the current through it provided its temperature remains the same n The resistance of a conductor depends directly on its length inversely on its area of crosssection and also on the material of the conductor n The equivalent resistance of
