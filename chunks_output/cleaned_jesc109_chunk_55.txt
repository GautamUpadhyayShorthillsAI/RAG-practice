as the reciprocal of its focal length It is represented by the letter P The power P of a lens of focal length f is given by P 1 f 911 202425 Science 158 The SI unit of power of a lens is dioptre It is denoted by the letter D If f is expressed in metres then power is expressed in dioptres Thus 1 dioptre is the power of a lens whose focal length is 1 metre 1D 1m1 You may note that the power of a convex lens is positive and that of a concave lens is negative Opticians prescribe corrective lenses indicating their powers Let us say the lens prescribed has power equal to 20 D This means the lens prescribed is convex The focal length of the lens is 050 m Similarly a lens of power 25 D has a focal length of 040 m The lens is concave Many optical instruments consist of a number of lenses They are combined to increase the magnification and sharpness of the image The net power P of the lenses placed in contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1 P2 P3 as P P1 P2 P3 The use
