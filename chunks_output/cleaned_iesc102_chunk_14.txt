A few common examples are given in Table 21 From this table you can see that they are very common everyday life Tyndall effect can be observed when sunlight passes through the canopy of a dense forest In the forest mist contains tiny droplets of water which act as particles of colloid dispersed in air Fig 24 The Tyndall effect uestions 1 Differentiate between homogen eous and heterogeneous mixtures with examples 2 How are sol solution and suspension different from each other 3 To make a saturated solution 36 g of sodium chloride is dissolved in 100 g of water at 293 K Find its concentration at this temperature Properties of a Colloid A colloid is a heterogeneous mixture The size of particles of a colloid is too small to be individually seen with naked eyes Table 21 Common examples of colloids Dispersed Dispersing Type Example phase Medium Liquid Gas Aerosol Fog clouds mist Solid Gas Aerosol Smoke automobile exhaust Gas Liquid Foam Shaving cream Liquid Liquid Emulsion Milk face cream
