Cu and Zn and bronze an alloy of copper and tin Cu and Sn are not good conductors of electricity whereas copper is used for making electrical circuits Solder an alloy of lead and tin Pb and Sn has a low melting point and is used for welding electrical wires together 351 Prevention of Corrosion The rusting of iron can be prevented by painting oiling greasing galvanising chrome plating anodising or making alloys Galvanisation is a method of protecting steel and iron from rusting by coating them with a thin layer of zinc The galvanised article is protected against rusting even if the zinc coating is broken Can you reason this out Alloying is a very good method of improving the properties of a metal We can get the desired properties by this method For example iron is the most widely used metal But it is never used in its pure state This is because pure iron is very soft and stretches easily when hot But if it is mixed with a small amount of carbon about 005 it becomes hard and strong When
