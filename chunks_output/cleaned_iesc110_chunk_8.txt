is 5 N 2 m 10 N m or 10 J Fig 104 Consider a situation in which an object is moving with a uniform velocity along a particular direction Now a retarding force F is applied in the opposite direction That is the angle between the two directions is 180 Let the object stop after a displacement s In such a situation the work done by the force F is taken as negative and denoted by the minus sign The work done by the force is F s or F s It is clear from the above discussion that the work done by a force can be either positive or negative To understand this let us do the following activity Activity 104 Lift an object up Work is done by the force exerted by you on the object The object moves upwards The force you exerted is in the direction of displacement However there is the force of gravity acting on the object Which one of these forces is doing positive work Which one is doing negative work Give reasons Work done is negative when the force acts opposite to the direction of displacement
