in contact is given by the algebraic sum of the individual powers P1 P2 P3 as P P1 P2 P3 The use of powers instead of focal lengths for lenses is quite convenient for opticians During eyetesting an optician puts several different combinations of corrective lenses of known power in contact inside the testing spectacles frame The optician calculates the power of the lens required by simple algebraic addition For example a combination of two lenses of power 20 D and 025 D is equivalent to a single lens of power 225 D The simple additive property of the powers of lenses can be used to design lens systems to minimise certain defects in images produced by a single lens Such a lens system consisting of several lenses in contact is commonly used in the design of lenses of camera microscopes and telescopes Q U E S T I O N S 1 Define 1 dioptre of power of a lens 2 A convex lens forms a real and inverted image of a needle at a distance of 50 cm from it Where is the needle placed in front of the
