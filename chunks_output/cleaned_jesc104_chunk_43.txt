with oil The soap molecules thus form structures called micelles see Fig 412 where one end of the molecules is towards the oil droplet while the ionicend faces outside This forms an emulsion in water The soap micelle thus helps in pulling out the dirt in water and we can wash our clothes clean Fig 413 Can you draw the structure of the micelle that would be formed if you dissolve soap in a hydrocarbon Micelles Soaps are molecules in which the two ends have differing properties one is hydrophilic that is it interacts with water while the other end is hydrophobic that is it interacts with hydrocarbons When soap is at the surface of water the hydrophobic tail of soap will not be soluble in water and the soap will align along the surface of water with the ionic end in water and the hydrocarbon tail protruding out of water Inside water these molecules have a unique orientation that keeps the hydrocarbon portion out of the water Thus clusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails are
