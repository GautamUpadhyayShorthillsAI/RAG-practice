placed in its path a State of Motion The state of motion of an object is described by its speed and the direction of motion The state of rest is considered to be the state of zero speed An object may be at rest or in motion both are its states of motion Paheli is curious to know whether application of a force can only change the speed of an object Let us find out Activity 84 Take a ball and place it on a level surface as you did in Activity 83 Make the ball move by giving it a push Fig 88a Now place a ruler in its path as shown in Fig 88b In doing so you would apply a force on the moving ball Does the ball continue to move in the same direction after it strikes the ruler Repeat the activity and try to obstruct the moving ball by placing the ruler in such a way that it makes different angles to its path In each case note your observations about the direction of motion of the ball after it strikes the ruler b Does it mean that the application of a force would always result in a change
