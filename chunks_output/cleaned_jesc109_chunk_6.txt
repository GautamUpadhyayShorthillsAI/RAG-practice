mirrors is shown in Fig 91 You may note in these diagrams that the back of the mirror is shaded You may now understand that the surface of the spoon curved inwards can be approximated to a concave mirror and the surface of the spoon bulged outwards can be approximated to a convex mirror Before we move further on spherical mirrors we need to recognise and understand the meaning of a few terms These terms are commonly used in discussions about spherical mirrors The centre of the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror is a point called the pole It lies on the surface of the mirror The pole is usually represented by the letter P Figure 91 Figure 91 Figure 91 Figure 91 Figure 91 Schematic representation of spherical mirrors the shaded side is nonreflecting a Concave mirror b Convex mirror 202425 Science 136 The reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part of a sphere This sphere has a centre This point is called the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror It is represented
