requiring use of energy The plasma membrane is flexible and is made up of organic molecules called lipids and proteins However we can observe the structure of the plasma membrane only through an electron microscope The flexibility of the cell membrane also enables the cell to engulf in food and other material from its external environment Such processes are known as endocytosis Amoeba acquires its food through such processes 202425 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE 53 Activity 55 Find out about electron microscopes from resources in the school library or through the internet Discuss it with your teacher uestions 1 How do substances like CO2 and water move in and out of the cell Discuss 2 Why is the plasma membrane called a selectively permeable membrane 522 CELL WALL Plant cells in addition to the plasma membrane have another rigid outer covering called the cell wall The cell wall lies outside the plasma membrane The plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose Cellulose is a complex
