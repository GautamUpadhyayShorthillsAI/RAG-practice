or fertilisation gives us the zygote which is capable of growing into a new plant Thus the pollen needs to be transferred from the stamen to the stigma If this transfer of pollen occurs in the same flower it is referred to as selfpollination On the other hand if the pollen is transferred from one flower to another it is known as cross pollination This transfer of pollen from one flower to another is achieved by agents like wind water or animals After the pollen lands on a suitable stigma it has to reach the female germcells which are in the ovary For this a tube grows out of the pollen grain and travels through the style to reach the ovary After fertilisation the zygote divides several times to form an embryo within the ovule The ovule develops a tough coat and is gradually converted into a seed The ovary grows rapidly and ripens to form a fruit Meanwhile the petals sepals stamens style and stigma may shrivel and fall off Have you ever observed any flower part still persisting in the
