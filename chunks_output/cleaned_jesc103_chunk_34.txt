carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium magnesium calcium aluminium etc to the respective metals This is because these metals have more affinity for oxygen than carbon These metals are obtained by electrolytic reduction For example sodium magnesium and calcium are obtained by the electrolysis of their molten chlorides The metals are deposited at the cathode the negatively charged electrode whereas chlorine is liberated at the anode the positively charged electrode The reactions are At cathode Na e Na At anode 2Cl Cl2 2e Similarly aluminium is obtained by the electrolytic reduction of aluminium oxide 346 Refining of Metals The metals produced by various reduction processes described above are not very pure They contain impurities which must be removed to obtain pure metals The most widely used method for refining impure metals is electrolytic refining Electrolytic Refining Electrolytic Refining Electrolytic Refining Electrolytic Refining Electrolytic Refining Many metals such as
