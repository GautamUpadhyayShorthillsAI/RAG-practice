taking place in the cell ATP ATP is the energy currency for most cellular processes The energy released during the process of respiration is used to make an ATP molecule from ADP and inorganic phosphate Endothermic processes in the cell then use this ATP to drive the reactions When the terminal phosphate linkage in ATP is broken using water the energy equivalent to 305 kJmol is released Think of how a battery can provide energy for many different kinds of uses It can be used to obtain mechanical energy light energy electrical energy and so on Similarly ATP can be used in the cells for the contraction of muscles protein synthesis conduction of nervous impulses and many other activities Since the aerobic respiration pathway depends on oxygen aerobic organisms need to ensure that there is sufficient intake of oxygen We have seen that plants exchange gases through stomata and the large intercellular spaces ensure that all cells are in contact with air Carbon dioxide and oxygen are
