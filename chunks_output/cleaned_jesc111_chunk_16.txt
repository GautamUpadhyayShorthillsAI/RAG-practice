of different material of the same length and the same area of crosssection is used On applying Ohms law Eqs 115 117 we observe that the resistance of the conductor depends i on its length ii on its area of crosssection and iii on the nature of its material Precise measurements have shown that resistance of a uniform metallic conductor is directly proportional to its length l and inversely proportional to the area of crosssection A That is R l 118 and R 1A 119 Combining Eqs 118 and 119 we get R l A or R l A 1110 where rho is a constant of proportionality and is called the electrical resistivity of the material of the conductor The SI unit of resistivity is m It is a characteristic property of the material The metals and alloys Figure 115 Figure 115 Figure 115 Figure 115 Figure 115 Electric circuit to study the factors on which the resistance of conducting wires depends n Now plug the key Note the current in the ammeter n Replace the nichrome wire by another nichrome wire of same
