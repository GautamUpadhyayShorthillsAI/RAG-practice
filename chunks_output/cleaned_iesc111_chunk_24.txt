frequency as low as 5 Hz Whales and elephants produce sound in the infrasound range It is observed that some animals get disturbed before earthquakes Earthquakes produce lowfrequency infrasound before the main shock waves begin which possibly alert the animals Frequencies higher than 20 kHz are called ultrasonic sound or ultrasound Ultrasound is produced by animals such as dolphins bats and porpoises Moths of certain families have very sensitive hearing equipment These moths can hear the high frequency Q Fig1111 Stethoscope 3 Generally the ceilings of concert halls conference halls and cinema halls are curved so that sound after reflection reaches all corners of the hall as shown in Fig 1112 Sometimes a curved soundboard may be placed behind the stage so that the sound after reflecting from the sound board spreads evenly across the width of the hall Fig 1113 In these instruments a tube followed by a conical opening reflects sound successively to guide most of the sound waves from the
