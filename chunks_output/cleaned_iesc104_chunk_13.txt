first orbit or Kshell will be 2 12 2 second orbit or Lshell will be 2 22 8 third orbit or Mshell will be 2 32 18 fourth orbit or Nshell will be 2 42 32 and so on ii The maximum number of electrons that can be accommodated in the outermost orbit is 8 iii Electrons are not accommodated in a given shell unless the inner shells are filled That is the shells are filled in a stepwise manner Atomic structure of the first eighteen elements is shown schematically in Fig 44 The composition of atoms of the first eighteen elements is given in Table 41 uestions 1 Write the distribution of electrons in carbon and sodium atoms 2 If K and L shells of an atom are full then what would be the total number of electrons in the atom 44 Valency We have learnt how the electrons in an atom are arranged in different shellsorbits The electrons present in the outermost shell of an atom are known as the valence electrons From the BohrBury scheme we also know that the outermost shell of an atom can Activity 42
