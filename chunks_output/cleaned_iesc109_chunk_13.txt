in time t In applying these equations we will take acceleration a to be positive when it is in the direction of the velocity that is in the direction of motion The acceleration a will be taken as negative when it opposes the motion Example 92 A car falls off a ledge and drops to the ground in 05 s Let g 10 m s 2 for simplifying the calculations i What is its speed on striking the ground ii What is its average speed during the 05 s iii How high is the ledge from the ground Solution Time t second Initial velocity u 0 m s1 Acceleration due to gravity g 10 m s2 Acceleration of the car a 10 m s2 downward i speed v a t v 10 m s2 05 s 5 m s1 ii average speed 2 u v 0 m s1 5 m s12 25 m s1 iii distance travelled s a t2 10 m s2 05 s2 10 m s2 025 s2 125 m Thus i its speed on striking the ground 5 m s1 ii its average speed during the 05 s 25 m s1 iii height of the ledge from the ground 125 m Example 93 An object is thrown vertically upwards and rises to a height of 10 m Calculate i the velocity
