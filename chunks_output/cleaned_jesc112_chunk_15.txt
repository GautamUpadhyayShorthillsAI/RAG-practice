pattern of the magnetic field lines produced around a currentcarrying straight wire Suppose this straight wire is bent in the form of a circular loop and a current is passed through it How would the magnetic field lines look like We know that the magnetic field produced by a currentcarrying straight wire depends inversely on the distance from it Similarly at every point of a currentcarrying circular loop the concentric circles representing the magnetic field around it would become larger and larger as we move away from the wire Fig 128 By the time we reach at the centre of the circular loop the arcs of these big circles would appear as straight lines Every point on the wire carrying current would give rise to the magnetic field appearing as straight lines at the center of the loop By applying the right hand rule it is easy to check that every section of the wire contributes to the magnetic field lines in the same direction within the loop Figure 128 Figure 128 Figure 128 Figure 128
