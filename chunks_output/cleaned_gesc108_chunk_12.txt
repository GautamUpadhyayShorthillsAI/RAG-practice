a result the seeds would not grow into healthy plants Plants benefit by seed dispersal It prevents competition between the plant and its own seedlings for sunlight water and minerals It also enables the plants to invade new habitats for wider distribution Seeds and fruits of plants are carried away by wind water and animals Winged seeds such as those of drumstick and maple Fig 813 a and b light seeds of grasses or hairy seeds of aak Madar and hairy fruit of sunflower Fig 814 a b get blown off with the wind to far away places Some seeds are dispersed by water These fruits or seeds usually develop floating ability in the form of spongy or fibrous outer coat as in coconut Some seeds are dispersed by animals especially spiny seeds with hooks which get attached to the bodies of animals and are carried to distant places Examples are Xanthium Fig 815 and Urena Some seeds are dispersed when the fruits burst with sudden jerks The seeds are scattered far from the parent plant This happens in
