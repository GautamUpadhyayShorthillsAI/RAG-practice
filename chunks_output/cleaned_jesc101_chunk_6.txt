the same on both sides of the equation Such a chemical equation is a skeletal chemical equation for a reaction Equation 12 is a skeletal chemical equation for the burning of magnesium in air 112 Balanced Chemical Equations Recall the law of conservation of mass that you studied in Class IX mass can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction That is the total mass of the elements present in the products of a chemical reaction has to be equal to the total mass of the elements present in the reactants In other words the number of atoms of each element remains the same before and after a chemical reaction Hence we need to balance a skeletal chemical equation Is the chemical Eq 12 balanced Let us learn about balancing a chemical equation step by step The wordequation for Activity 13 may be represented as Zinc Sulphuric acid Zinc sulphate Hydrogen The above wordequation may be represented by the following chemical equation Zn H2SO4 ZnSO4 H2 13 Let us examine the number of atoms
