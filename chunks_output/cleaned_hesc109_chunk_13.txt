Rolling reduces friction 202425 FRICTION 119 96 Fluid Friction You know that air is very light and thin Yet it exerts frictional force on objects moving through it Similarly water and other liquids exert force of friction when objects move through them In science the common name of gases and liquids is fluids So we can say that fluids exert force of friction on objects in motion through them The frictional force exerted by fluids is also called drag The frictional force on an object in a fluid depends on its speed with respect to the fluid The frictional force also depends on the shape of the object and the nature of the fluid It is obvious that when objects move through fluids they have to overcome friction acting on them In this process they lose energy Efforts are therefore made to minimise friction So objects are given special shapes Where do you think scientists get hints for these special shapes From nature of course Birds and fishes have to move about in fluids all the time
