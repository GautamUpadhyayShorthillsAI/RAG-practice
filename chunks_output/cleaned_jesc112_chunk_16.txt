field lines in the same direction within the loop Figure 128 Figure 128 Figure 128 Figure 128 Figure 128 Magnetic field lines of the field produced by a currentcarrying circular loop Q U E S T I O N S 1 Draw magnetic field lines around a bar magnet 2 List the properties of magnetic field lines 3 Why dont two magnetic field lines intersect each other 202425 Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 201 We know that the magnetic field produced by a currentcarrying wire at a given point depends directly on the current passing through it Therefore if there is a circular coil having n turns the field produced is n times as large as that produced by a single turn This is because the current in each circular turn has the same direction and the field due to each turn then just adds up Activity 126 Activity 126 Activity 126 Activity 126 Activity 126 n Take a rectangular cardboard having two holes Insert a circular coil having large number of turns through them normal to the plane of the cardboard n
