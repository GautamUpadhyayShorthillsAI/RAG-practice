tall epithelial cells are present This columnar meaning pillarlike epithelium facilitates movement across the epithelial barrier In the respiratory tract the columnar epithelial tissue also has cilia which are hairlike projections on the outer surfaces of epithelial cells These cilia can move and their movement pushes the mucus forward to clear it This type of epithelium is thus ciliated columnar epithelium Cuboidal epithelium with cubeshaped cells forms the lining of kidney tubules and ducts of salivary glands where it provides mechanical support Epithelial cells often acquire additional specialisation as gland cells which can secrete substances at the epithelial surface Sometimes a portion of the epithelial tissue folds inward and a multicellular gland is formed This is glandular epithelium 632 CONNECTIVE TISSUE Blood is a type of connective tissue Why would it be called connective tissue A clue is provided in the introduction of this chapter Now let us look at this type of tissue
