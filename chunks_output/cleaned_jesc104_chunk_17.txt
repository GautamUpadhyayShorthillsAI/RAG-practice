compounds These compounds are normally not very reactive However another compound of carbon and hydrogen has the formula C2H4 and is called ethene How can this molecule be depicted We follow the same stepwise approach as above Carboncarbon atoms linked together with a single bond Step 1 We see that one valency per carbon atom remains unsatisfied Step 2 This can be satisfied only if there is a double bond between the two carbons Step 3 Figure 46 Figure 46 Figure 46 Figure 46 Figure 46 c Electron dot structure of ethane More to Know Step 2 Step 3 CC Step 1 202425 Science 64 The electron dot structure for ethene is given in Fig 47 Yet another compound of hydrogen and carbon has the formula C2H2 and is called ethyne Can you draw the electron dot structure for ethyne How many bonds are necessary between the two carbon atoms in order to satisfy their valencies Such compounds of carbon having double or triple bonds between the carbon atoms are known as unsaturated carbon compounds and they
