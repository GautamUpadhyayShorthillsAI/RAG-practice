proportional to the product of their masses That is FM m 91 And the force between two objects is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them that is 2 1 F d 92 Combining Eqs 101 and 102 we get F 2 M m d 93 or G 2 M m F d 94 where G is the constant of proportionality and is called the universal gravitation constant By multiplying crosswise Eq 94 gives F d 2 G M m 202425 SCIENCE 102 From Eq 94 the force exerted by the earth on the moon is G 2 M m F d 11 2 2 24 22 8 2 67 10 N m kg 6 10 kg 74 10 kg 384 10 m 202 1020 N Thus the force exerted by the earth on the moon is 202 1020 N uestions 1 State the universal law of gravitation 2 Write the formula to find the magnitude of the gravitational force between the earth and an object on the surface of the earth 912 IMPORTANCE OF THE UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION The universal law of gravitation successfully explained several phenomena which were believed to be unconnected i the force that binds us to the earth ii the motion
