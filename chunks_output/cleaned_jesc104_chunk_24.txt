increasing molecular mass Other physical properties such as solubility in a particular solvent also show a similar gradation But the chemical properties which are determined solely by the functional group remain similar in a homologous series Activity 42 Activity 42 Activity 42 Activity 42 Activity 42 425 Nomenclature of Carbon Compounds The names of compounds in a homologous series are based on the name of the basic carbon chain modified by a prefix phrase before or suffix phrase after indicating the nature of the functional group For example the names of the alcohols taken in Activity 42 are methanol ethanol propanol and butanol Naming a carbon compound can be done by the following method i Identify the number of carbon atoms in the compound A compound having three carbon atoms would have the name propane ii In case a functional group is present it is indicated in the name of the compound with either a prefix or a suffix as given in Table 44 iii If the name of the functional group
