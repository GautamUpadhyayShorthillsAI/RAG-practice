think of examples of these kinds of directional growth movements One example of chemotropism is the growth of pollen tubes towards ovules about which we will learn more when we examine the reproductive processes of living organisms Let us now once again think about how information is communicated in the bodies of multicellular organisms The movement of the sensitive plant in response to touch is very quick The movement of sunflowers in response to day or night on the other hand is quite slow Growthrelated movement of plants will be even slower Even in animal bodies there are carefully controlled directions to growth Our arms and fingers grow in certain directions not haphazardly So controlled movements can be either slow or fast If fast responses to stimuli are to be made information transfer must happen very quickly For this the medium of transmission must be able to move rapidly Activity 62 Activity 62 Activity 62 Activity 62 Activity 62 n Fill a conical flask with water n Cover the
