elements involved in the reactions For example to balance oxygen atoms we can put coefficient 4 as 4 H2O and not H2O4 or H2O4 Now the partly balanced equation becomes Fe 4 H2O Fe3O4 H2 Step IV Fe and H atoms are still not balanced Pick any of these elements to proceed further Let us balance hydrogen atoms in the partly balanced equation To equalise the number of H atoms make the number of molecules of hydrogen as four on the RHS Step III It is often convenient to start balancing with the compound that contains the maximum number of atoms It may be a reactant or a product In that compound select the element which has the maximum number of atoms Using these criteria we select Fe3O4 and the element oxygen in it There are four oxygen atoms on the RHS and only one on the LHS To balance the oxygen atoms The equation would be Fe 4 H2O Fe3O4 4 H2 Atoms of In reactants In products oxygen i Initial 1 in H2O 4 in Fe3O4 ii To balance 14 4 Atoms of In reactants In products hydrogen i Initial 8 in
