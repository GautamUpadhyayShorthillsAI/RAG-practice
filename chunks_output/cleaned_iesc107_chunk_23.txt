a car being driven along a straight road for testing its engine Suppose a person sitting next to the driver records its velocity after every 5 seconds by noting the reading of the speedometer of the car The velocity of the car in km h1 as well as in m s1 at different instants of time is shown in table 73 Table 73 Velocity of a car at regular instants of time Time Velocity of the car s m s1 km h 1 0 0 0 5 25 9 10 50 18 15 75 27 20 100 36 25 125 45 30 150 54 202425 SCIENCE 80 In this case the velocitytime graph for the motion of the car is shown in Fig 76 The nature of the graph shows that velocity changes by equal amounts in equal intervals of time Thus for all uniformly accelerated motion the velocitytime graph is a straight line Fig 76 Velocitytime graph for a car moving with uniform accelerations You can also determine the distance moved by the car from its velocitytime graph The area under the velocitytime graph gives the distance magnitude of displacement moved by the car in a
