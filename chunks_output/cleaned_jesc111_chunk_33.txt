spending lot of time in troublelocating and replacing the dead bulb each has to be tested to find which has fused or gone On the other hand a parallel circuit divides the current through the electrical gadgets The total resistance in a parallel circuit is decreased as per Eq 1118 This is helpful particularly when each gadget has different resistance and requires different current to operate properly Figure 1112 Figure 1112 Figure 1112 Figure 1112 Figure 1112 An electric circuit showing the combination of series and parallel resistors 202425 Science 188 117 HEA 117 HEA 117 HEA 117 HEA 117 HEATING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT TING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT TING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT TING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT TING EFFECT OF ELECTRIC CURRENT We know that a battery or a cell is a source of electrical energy The chemical reaction within the cell generates the potential difference between its two terminals that sets the electrons in motion to flow the current through a resistor or
