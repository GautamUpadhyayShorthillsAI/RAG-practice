the Sun on a sheet of paper Obtain a sharp bright image of the Sun n Hold the paper and the lens in the same position for a while Keep observing the paper What happened Why Recall your experience in Activity 92 The paper begins to burn producing smoke It may even catch fire after a while Why does this happen The light from the Sun constitutes parallel rays of light These rays were converged by the lens at the sharp bright spot formed on the paper In fact the bright spot you got on the paper is a real image of the Sun The concentration of the sunlight at a point generated heat This caused the paper to burn Now we shall consider rays of light parallel to the principal axis of a lens What happens when you pass such rays of light through a lens This is illustrated for a convex lens in Fig912 a and for a concave lens in Fig912 b Observe Fig912 a carefully Several rays of light parallel to the principal axis are falling on a convex lens These rays after refraction from the lens are
