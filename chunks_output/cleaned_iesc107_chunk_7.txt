is zero However the distance covered in this journey is OA AO 60 km 60 km 120 km Thus two different physical quantitiesthe distance and the displacement MOTION 73 202425 SCIENCE 74 uestions 1 An object has moved through a distance Can it have zero displacement If yes support your answer with an example 2 A farmer moves along the boundary of a square field of side 10 m in 40 s What will be the magnitude of displacement of the farmer at the end of 2 minutes 20 seconds from his initial position 3 Which of the following is true for displacement a It cannot be zero b Its magnitude is greater than the distance travelled by the object 712 UNIFORM MOTION AND NON UNIFORM MOTION Consider an object moving along a straight line Let it travel 5 m in the first second 5 m more in the next second 5 m in the third second and 5 m in the fourth second In this case the object covers 5 m in each second As the object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time it is said to be in uniform motion The
