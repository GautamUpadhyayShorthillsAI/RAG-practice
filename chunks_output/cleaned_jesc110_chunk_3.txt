distances on the retina We find a structure called iris behind the cornea Iris is a dark muscular diaphragm that controls the size of the pupil The pupil regulates and controls the amount of light Figure 101 Figure 101 Figure 101 Figure 101 Figure 101 The human eye 202425 Science 162 entering the eye The eye lens forms an inverted real image of the object on the retina The retina is a delicate membrane having enormous number of lightsensitive cells The lightsensitive cells get activated upon illumination and generate electrical signals These signals are sent to the brain via the optic nerves The brain interprets these signals and finally processes the information so that we perceive objects as they are 1011 Power of Accommodation The eye lens is composed of a fibrous jellylike material Its curvature can be modified to some extent by the ciliary muscles The change in the curvature of the eye lens can thus change its focal length When the muscles are relaxed the lens becomes thin Thus
