is so chosen that the value of the constant k becomes one For this one unit of force is defined as the amount that produces an acceleration of 1 m s2 in an object of 1 kg mass That is 1 unit of force k 1 kg 1 m s2 Thus the value of k becomes 1 From Eq 83 F ma 84 The unit of force is kg m s2 or newton which has the symbol N The second law of 202425 FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 93 93 93 93 93 motion gives us a method to measure the force acting on an object as a product of its mass and acceleration The second law of motion is often seen in action in our everyday life Have you noticed that while catching a fast moving cricket ball a fielder in the ground gradually pulls his hands backwards with the moving ball In doing so the fielder increases the time during which the high velocity of the moving ball decreases to zero Thus the acceleration of the ball is decreased and therefore the impact of catching the fast moving ball Fig 88 is also reduced If the ball is stopped suddenly then its high
