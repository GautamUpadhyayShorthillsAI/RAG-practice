1 J s1 We express larger rates of energy transfer in kilowatts kW 1 kilowatt 1000 watts 1 kW 1000 W 1 kW 1000 J s1 The power of an agent may vary with time This means that the agent may be doing work at different rates at different intervals of time Therefore the concept of average power is useful We obtain average power by dividing the total energy consumed by the total time taken Example 107 Two girls each of weight 400 N climb up a rope through a height of 8 m We name one of the girls A and the other B Girl A takes 20 s while B takes 50 s to accomplish this task What is the power expended by each girl Solution i Power expended by girl A Weight of the girl mg 400 N Displacement height h 8 m Activity 1015 An object of mass 20 kg is dropped from a height of 4 m Fill in the blanks in the following table by computing the potential energy and kinetic energy in each case Height at Potential Kinetic Ep Ek which object energy energy is located Ep mgh Ek mv22 m J J J 4 3 2 1 Just above the
