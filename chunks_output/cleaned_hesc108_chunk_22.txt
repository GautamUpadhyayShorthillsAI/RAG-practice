the force is applied for example the pointed end of the nail plays a role in making these tasks easier The force acting on a unit area of a surface is called pressure pressure force area on which it acts At this stage we consider only those forces which act perpendicular to the surface on which the pressure is to be computed Gravity is not a property of the earth alone In fact every object in the universe whether small or large exerts a force on every other object This force is known as the gravitational force 88 Pressure Is there any relation between pressure and force Let us find out Try to push a nail into a wooden plank by its head Did you succeed Try now to push the nail by the pointed end Fig 812 Could you do it this time I now understand why porters place a round piece of cloth on their heads when they have to carry heavy loads Fig 813 By doing this they increase the area of contact of the load with their head So the pressure on their head is reduced and they find it easier to
