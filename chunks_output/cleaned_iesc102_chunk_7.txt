of the solution that is dissolved in the solvent usually present in lesser quantity is called the solute Examples i A solution of sugar in water is a solid in liquid solution In this solution sugar is the solute and water is the solvent ii A solution of iodine in alcohol known as tincture of iodine has iodine solid as the solute and alcohol liquid as the solvent iii Aerated drinks like soda water etc are gas in liquid solutions These contain carbon dioxide gas as solute and water liquid as solvent iv Air is a mixture of gas in gas Air is a homogeneous mixture of a number of gases Its two main constituents are oxygen 21 and nitrogen 78 The other gases are present in very small quantities Properties of a Solution A solution is a homogeneous mixture The particles of a solution are smaller than 1 nm 109 metre in diameter So they cannot be seen by naked eyes Because of very small particle size they do not scatter a beam of light passing through the solution So the path of light is not
