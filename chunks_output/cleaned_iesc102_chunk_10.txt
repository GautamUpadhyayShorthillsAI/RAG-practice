from the above activity that different substances in a given solvent have different solubilities at the same temperature The concentration of a solution is the amount mass or volume of solute present in a given amount mass or volume of solution There are various ways of expressing the concentration of a solution but here we will learn only three methods i Mass by mass percentage of a solution Mass of solute 100 Mass of solution 202425 IS MATTER AROUND US PURE 17 ii Mass by volume percentage of a solution Mass of solute 100 Volume of solution iii Volume by volume percentage of a solution Volume of solute 100 Volume of solution Example 21 A solution contains 40 g of common salt in 320 g of water Calculate the concentration in terms of mass by mass percentage of the solution Solution Mass of solute salt 40 g Mass of solvent water 320 g We know Mass of solution Mass of solute Mass of solvent 40 g 320 g 360 g Mass percentage of solution Mass of solute 100 Massof solution 40 100 111 360 222
