a metallic conductor We see that the needle is deflected What does it mean It means that the electric current through the copper wire has produced a magnetic effect Thus we can say that electricity and magnetism are linked to each other Then what about the reverse possibility of an electric effect of moving magnets In this Chapter we will study magnetic fields and such electromagnetic effects We shall also study about electromagnets which involve the magnetic effect of electric current Hans Christian Oersted 17771851 Hans Christian Oersted one of the leading scientists of the 19th century played a crucial role in understanding electromagnetism In 1820 he accidentally discovered that a compass needle got deflected when an electric current passed through a metallic wire placed nearby Through this observation Oersted showed that electricity and magnetism were related phenomena His research later created technologies such as the radio television and fiber optics The unit of magnetic field
