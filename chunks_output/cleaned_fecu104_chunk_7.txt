direction The end of the magnet that points towards north direction is called the Northseeking pole or the North pole of the magnet The other end that points towards the South direction is called the Southseeking pole or the South pole of the magnet A freely suspended magnet rests along the northsouth direction because our Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet Repeat this activity with a small iron bar in place of the bar magnet What do you observe Does it always rest along northsouth direction It does not It can rest along any direction This implies that only magnets rest along northsouth direction This activity provides us with a way to test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or not The property of a freely suspended magnet to always rest along the northsouth direction is used to find directions Based on this a small device called a magnetic compass was developed in olden days for finding directions It has a magnet in the shape of a needle which can rotate freely Fig 46 The
