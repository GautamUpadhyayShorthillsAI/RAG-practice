element will combine with the atoms of another element to form a chemical compound The valency of the atom of an element can be thought of as hands or arms of that atom Human beings have two arms and an octopus has eight If one octopus has to catch hold of a few people in such a manner that all the eight arms of the octopus and both arms of all the humans are locked how many humans do you think the octopus can hold Represent the octopus with O and humans with H Can you write a formula for this combination Do you get OH4 as the formula The subscript 4 indicates the number of humans held by the octopus The valencies of some common ions are given in Table 36 We will learn more about valency in the next chapter Some elements show more than one valency A Roman numeral shows their valency in a bracket Table 35 Some ionic compounds Ionic Constituting Ratio Compound Elements by Mass Calcium oxide Calcium and oxygen 52 Magnesium Magnesium sulphide and sulphur 34 Sodium Sodium chloride and
