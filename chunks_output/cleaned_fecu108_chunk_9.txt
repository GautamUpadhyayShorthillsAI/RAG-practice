an activity to find evidence for their reasons You can also conduct the activity by following the steps given below Record your data in Table 82 Take a glass tumbler halffilled with water containing a few ice cubes Cover it with a small steel plate Weigh it on a digital weighing balance Observe the reading on the balance and record the weight after every five minutes Continue observing for 30 minutes Record your observations in Table 82 Predict what will happen to the mass of cold water kept on the digital weighing balance Will it increase or decrease or remain the same Dew drops on plants A Journey through States of Water 149 Do your findings match with your predictions Explain your observations You may observe some water droplets on the glass tumbler Water vapour from the air comes in contact with the cold surface of the glass tumbler and gets converted into water droplets on the glass tumbler through condensation There is an increase in the reading on the digital weighing balance
