the same or different elements was thus explained as an attempt to attain a fullyfilled outermost shell An outermostshell which had eight electrons was said to possess an octet Atoms would thus react so as to achieve an octet in the outermost shell This was done by sharing gaining or losing electrons The number of electrons gained lost or shared so as to make the octet of electrons in the outermost shell gives us directly the combining capacity of the element that is the valency discussed in the previous chapter For example hydrogen lithiumsodium atoms contain one electron each in their outermost shell therefore each one of them can lose one electron So they are said to have valency of one Can you tell what is valency of magnesium and aluminium It is two and three respectively because magnesium has two electrons in its outermost shell and aluminium has three electrons in its outermost shell If the number of electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is close to its full capacity then
