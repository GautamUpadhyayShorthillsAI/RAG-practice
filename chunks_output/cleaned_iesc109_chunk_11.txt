this acceleration is called the acceleration due to the gravitational force of the earth or acceleration due to gravity It is denoted by g The unit of g is the same as that of acceleration that is m s2 We know from the second law of motion that force is the product of mass and acceleration Let the mass of the stone in activity 92 be m We already know that there is acceleration involved in falling objects due to the gravitational force and is denoted by g Therefore the magnitude of the gravitational force F will be equal to the product of mass and acceleration due to the gravitational force that is F m g 96 From Eqs 94 and 96 we have 2 G M m m g d or G 2 M g d 97 where M is the mass of the earth and d is the distance between the object and the earth Let an object be on or near the surface of the earth The distance d in Eq 97 will be equal to R the radius of the earth Thus for objects on or near the surface of the earth G 2 M m mg R 98 G 2 M g R 99 The earth is not a perfect sphere As
