n The magnification produced by a spherical mirror is the ratio of the height of the image to the height of the object n A light ray travelling obliquely from a denser medium to a rarer medium bends away from the normal A light ray bends towards the normal when it travels obliquely from a rarer to a denser medium n Light travels in vacuum with an enormous speed of 3108 m s1 The speed of light is different in different media n The refractive index of a transparent medium is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to that in the medium n In case of a rectangular glass slab the refraction takes place at both airglass interface and glassair interface The emergent ray is parallel to the direction of incident ray n Lens formula 1 1 1 v u f gives the relationship between the objectdistance u imagedistance v and the focal length f of a spherical lens n Power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length The SI unit of power of a lens is dioptre E X E R C I S E S 1 Which one of the
