FERTILIZERS Fertilizers are commercially produced plant nutrients Fertilizers supply nitrogen phosphorus and potassium They are used to ensure good vegetative growth leaves branches and flowers giving rise to healthy plants Fertilizers are a factor in the higher yields of highcost farming Fertilizers should be applied carefully in terms of proper dose time and observing pre and postapplication precautions for their complete utilisation For example sometimes fertilizers get washed away due to excessive irrigation and are not fully absorbed by the plants This excess fertilizer then leads to water pollution Also as we have seen in the previous chapter continuous use of fertilizers in an area can destroy soil fertility because the organic matter in the soil is not replenished and microorganisms in the soil are harmed by the fertilizers used Shortterm benefits of using fertilizers and longterm benefits of using Deficiency of these nutrients affects physiological processes in plants
