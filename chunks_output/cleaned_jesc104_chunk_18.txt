double or triple bonds between the carbon atoms are known as unsaturated carbon compounds and they are more reactive than the saturated carbon compounds 422 Chains Branches and Rings In the earlier section we mentioned the carbon compounds methane ethane and propane containing respectively 1 2 and 3 carbon atoms Such chains of carbon atoms can contain many more carbon atoms The names and structures of six of these are given in Table 42 Figure 47 Figure 47 Figure 47 Figure 47 Figure 47 Structure of ethene Table 42 Formulae and structures of saturated compounds of carbon and hydrogen No of C Name Formula Structure atoms 1 Methane CH4 2 Ethane C2H6 3 Propane C3H8 4 Butane C4H10 5 Pentane C5H12 6 Hexane C6H14 202425 Carbon and its Compounds 65 But let us take another look at butane If we make the carbon skeleton with four carbon atoms we see that two different possible skeletons are CCCC Figure 48 Figure 48 Figure 48 Figure 48 Figure 48 a Two possible carbonskeletons Filling the remaining
