which other substances produce hydrogen on reacting with metals ii Reaction to give unsaturated hydrocarbon Heating ethanol at 443 K with excess concentrated sulphuric acid results in the dehydration of ethanol to give ethene CH CH OH CH CH H O 3 2 2 2 2 Hot Conc H SO 2 4 The concentrated sulphuric acid can be regarded as a dehydrating agent which removes water from ethanol How do alcohols affect living beings When large quantities of ethanol are consumed it tends to slow metabolic processes and to depress the central nervous system This results in lack of coordination mental confusion drowsiness lowering of the normal inhibitions and finally stupor The individual may feel relaxed without realising that his sense of judgement sense of timing and muscular coordination have been seriously impaired Unlike ethanol intake of methanol in very small quantities can cause death Methanol is oxidised to methanal in the liver Methanal reacts rapidly with the components of cells It coagulates the
