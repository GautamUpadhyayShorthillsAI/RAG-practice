to solid without changing into liquid is called deposition 142 EFFECT OF CHANGE OF PRESSURE We have already learnt that the difference in various states of matter is due to the difference in the distances between the constituent particles What will happen when we start putting pressure and compress a gas Fig 19 Interconversion of the three states of matter Deposition 202425 MATTER IN OUR SURROUNDINGS 9 dish and keep it inside a cupboard or on a shelf in your class Record the room temperature Record the time or days taken for the evaporation process in the above cases Repeat the above three steps of activity on a rainy day and record your observations What do you infer about the effect of temperature surface area and wind velocity speed on evaporation You must have observed that the rate of evaporation increases with an increase of surface area We know that evaporation is a surface phenomenon If the surface area is increased the rate of evaporation increases For example while putting
