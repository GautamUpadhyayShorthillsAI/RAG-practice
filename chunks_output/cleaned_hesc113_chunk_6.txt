a little more about the formation of an image by a plane mirror in the following way Activity 133 A source of light O is placed in front of a plane mirror PQ Two rays OA and OC are incident on it Fig 135 Can you find out the direction of the reflected rays Draw normals to the surface of the mirror PQ at the points A and C Then draw the reflected rays at the points A and C How would you draw these rays Call the reflected rays AB and CD respectively Extend them further Do they meet Extend them backwards Do they meet now If they meet mark this point as I For a viewers eye at E Fig 13 5 do the reflected rays b Fig 134 a b Incident ray reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence lie in the same plane When the whole sheet of paper is spread on the table it represents one plane The incident ray the normal at the point of incidence and the reflected ray are all in this plane When you bend the paper you create a plane different from the plane in which the incident ray and the normal
