has a centre This point is called the centre of curvature of the spherical mirror It is represented by the letter C Please note that the centre of curvature is not a part of the mirror It lies outside its reflecting surface The centre of curvature of a concave mirror lies in front of it However it lies behind the mirror in case of a convex mirror You may note this in Fig92 a and b The radius of the sphere of which the reflecting surface of a spherical mirror forms a part is called the radius of curvature of the mirror It is represented by the letter R You may note that the distance PC is equal to the radius of curvature Imagine a straight line passing through the pole and the centre of curvature of a spherical mirror This line is called the principal axis Remember that principal axis is normal to the mirror at its pole Let us understand an important term related to mirrors through an Activity Activity 92 Activity 92 Activity 92 Activity 92 Activity 92 CAUTION Do not look at the Sun
