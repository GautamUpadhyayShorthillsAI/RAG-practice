studied about the image formation by plane mirrors You also know the nature position and relative size of the images formed by them How about the images formed by spherical mirrors How can we locate the image formed by a concave mirror for different positions of the object Are the images real or virtual Are they enlarged diminished or have the same size We shall explore this with an Activity Activity 93 Activity 93 Activity 93 Activity 93 Activity 93 You have already learnt a way of determining the focal length of a concave mirror In Activity 92 you have seen that the sharp bright spot of light you got on the paper is in fact the image of the Sun It was a tiny real inverted image You got the approximate focal length of the concave mirror by measuring the distance of the image from the mirror n Take a concave mirror Find out its approximate focal length in the way described above Note down the value of focal length You can also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object on a
