base Trace the outline of the prism using a pencil n Draw a straight line PE inclined to one of the refracting surfaces say AB of the prism n Fix two pins say at points P and Q on the line PE as shown in Fig 104 n Look for the images of the pins fixed at P and Q through the other face AC n Fix two more pins at points R and S such that the pins at R and S and the images of the pins at P and Q lie on the same straight line n Remove the pins and the glass prism n The line PE meets the boundary of the prism at point E see Fig 104 Similarly join and produce the points R and S Let these lines meet the boundary of the prism at E and F respectively Join E and F n Draw perpendiculars to the refracting surfaces AB and AC of the prism at points E and F respectively n Mark the angle of incidence i the angle of refraction r and the angle of emergence e as shown in Fig 104 202425 Science 166 Activity 102 Activity 102 Activity 102 Activity 102 Activity 102 n Take a thick sheet of cardboard and make
