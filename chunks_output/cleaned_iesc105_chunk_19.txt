organising cells Functional segments of DNA are called genes In a cell which is not dividing this DNA is present as part of chromatin material Chromatin material is visible as entangled mass of thread like structures Whenever the cell is about to divide the chromatin material gets organised into chromosomes The nucleus plays a central role in cellular reproduction the process by which a single cell divides and forms two new cells It also plays a crucial part along with the environment in determining the way the cell will develop and what form it will exhibit at maturity by directing the chemical activities of the cell In some organisms like bacteria the nuclear region of the cell may be poorly defined due to the absence of a nuclear membrane Such an undefined nuclear region containing only nucleic acids is called a nucleoid Such organisms whose cells lack a nuclear membrane are called prokaryotes Pro primitive or primary karyote karyon nucleus Organisms with cells having a nuclear
