the direction the block moves This suggests that an unbalanced force acting on an object brings it in motion Fig 83 Two forces acting on a wooden block What happens when some children try to push a box on a rough floor If they push the a b c Fig 84 202425 FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 89 removed completely the object would continue to move with the velocity it has acquired till then 82 First Law of Motion By observing the motion of objects on an inclined plane Galileo deduced that objects move with a constant speed when no force acts on them He observed that when a marble rolls down an inclined plane its velocity increases Fig 85a In the next chapter you will learn that the marble falls under the unbalanced force of gravity as it rolls down and attains a definite velocity by the time it reaches the bottom Its velocity decreases when it climbs up as shown in Fig 85b Fig 85c shows a marble resting on an ideal frictionless plane inclined on both sides Galileo argued that when the marble is
