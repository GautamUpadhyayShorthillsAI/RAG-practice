at the time it was released just like the piece of stone in the activity described above There are many more familiar examples of objects moving under uniform circular motion such as the motion of the moon and the earth a satellite in a circular orbit around the earth a cyclist on a circular track at constant speed and so on What you have learnt Motion is a change of position it can be described in terms of the distance moved or the displacement The motion of an object could be uniform or nonuniform depending on whether its velocity is constant or changing The speed of an object is the distance covered per unit time and velocity is the displacement per unit time The acceleration of an object is the change in velocity per unit time Uniform and nonuniform motions of objects can be shown through graphs The motion of an object moving at uniform acceleration can be described with the help of the following equations namely v u at s ut at2 2as v2 u2 Fig 79 A stone describing a circular path
