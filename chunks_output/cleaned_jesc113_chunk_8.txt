of the food eaten is turned into its own body and made available for the next level of consumers n Therefore 10 can be taken as the average value for the amount of organic matter that is present at each step and reaches the next level of consumers n Since so little energy is available for the next level of consumers food chains generally consist of only three or four steps The loss of energy at each step is so great that very little usable energy remains after four trophic levels n There are generally a greater number of individuals at the lower trophic levels of an ecosystem the greatest number is of the producers n The length and complexity of food chains vary greatly Each organism is generally eaten by two or more other kinds of organisms which in turn are eaten by several other organisms So instead of a straight line food chain the relationship can be shown as a series of branching lines called a food web Fig 133 Figure 131 Figure 131 Figure 131 Figure 131 Figure 131 Food chain in
