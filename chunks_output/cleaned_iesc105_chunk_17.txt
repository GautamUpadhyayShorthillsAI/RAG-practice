see what the difference is Further when we put iodine solution on the peel did each cell get evenly coloured According to their chemical composition different regions of cells get coloured differentially Some regions appear darker than other regions Apart from iodine solution we could also use safranin solution or methylene blue solution to stain the cells We have observed cells from an onion let us now observe cells from our own body Activity 57 Let us take a glass slide with a drop of water on it Using an icecream spoon gently scrape the inside surface of the cheek Does any material get stuck on the spoon With the help of a needle we can transfer this material and spread it evenly on the glass slide kept ready for this To colour the material we can put a drop of methylene blue solution on it Now the material is ready for observation under microscope Do not forget to put a coverslip on it What do we observe What is the shape of the cells we see Draw it on the observation sheet Q
