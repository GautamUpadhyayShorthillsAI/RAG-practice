Give reasons Work done is negative when the force acts opposite to the direction of displacement Work done is positive when the force is in the direction of displacement Example 102 A porter lifts a luggage of 15 kg from the ground and puts it on his head 15 m above the ground Calculate the work done by him on the luggage Solution Mass of luggage m 15 kg and displacement s 15 m Fig 102 uestion 1 A force of 7 N acts on an object The displacement is say 8 m in the direction of the force Fig 103 Let us take it that the force acts on the object through the displacement What is the work done in this case Fig 103 Consider another situation in which the force and the displacement are in the same direction a baby pulling a toy car parallel to the ground as shown in Fig 104 The baby has exerted a force in the direction of displacement of the car In this situation the work done will be equal to the product of the force and displacement In such situations the work done by the force is taken as
