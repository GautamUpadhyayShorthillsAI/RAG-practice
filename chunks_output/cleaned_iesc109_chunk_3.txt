Again note the direction of motion of the stone Fig 91 A stone describing a circular path with a velocity of constant magnitude Before the thread is released the stone moves in a circular path with a certain speed and changes direction at every point The change in direction involves change in velocity or acceleration The force that causes this acceleration and keeps the body moving along the circular path is acting towards the centre This force is called the centripetal meaning centreseeking force 9 G GG GGRAVITATION RAVITATION RAVITATION RAVITATION RAVITATION C hapter 202425 GRAVITATION 101 911 UNIVERSAL LAW OF GRAVITATION Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force which is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them The force is along the line joining the centres of two objects In the absence of this force the stone flies off along a straight line This straight line will be a tangent to
