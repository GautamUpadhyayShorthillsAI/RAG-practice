Formation Even in many simple multicellular organisms specific reproductive parts can be identified The threadlike structures that developed on the bread in Activity 72 above are the hyphae of the bread mould Rhizopus They are not reproductive parts On the other hand the tiny blobonastick structures are involved in reproduction The blobs are sporangia which contain cells or spores that can eventually develop into new Rhizopus individuals Fig 76 The spores are covered by thick walls that protect them until they come into contact with another moist surface and can begin to grow Figure 76 Figure 76 Figure 76 Figure 76 Figure 76 Spore formation in Rhizopus Activity 75 Activity 75 Activity 75 Activity 75 Activity 75 n Take a potato and observe its surface Can notches be seen n Cut the potato into small pieces such that some pieces contain a notch or bud and some do not n Spread some cotton on a tray and wet it Place the potato pieces on this cotton Note where the pieces with the buds are
