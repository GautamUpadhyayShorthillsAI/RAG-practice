permanganate persist when it is added initially n Why does the colour of potassium permanganate not disappear when excess is added You have learnt about oxidation reactions in the first Chapter Carbon compounds can be easily oxidised on combustion In addition to this complete oxidation we have reactions in which alcohols are converted to carboxylic acids More to Know 202425 Carbon and its Compounds 71 We see that some substances are capable of adding oxygen to others These substances are known as oxidising agents Alkaline potassium permanganate or acidified potassium dichromate are oxidising alcohols to acids that is adding oxygen to the starting material Hence they are known as oxidising agents 433 Addition Reaction Unsaturated hydrocarbons add hydrogen in the presence of catalysts such as palladium or nickel to give saturated hydrocarbons Catalysts are substances that cause a reaction to occur or proceed at a different rate without the reaction itself being affected This reaction is
