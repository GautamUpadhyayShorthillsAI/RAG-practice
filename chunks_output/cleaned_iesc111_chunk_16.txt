because our ear detects it better of less energy amplitude If we hit the table hard we hear a louder sound Can you tell why A sound wave spreads out from its source As it moves away from the source its amplitude as well as its loudness decreases Louder sound can travel a larger distance as it is associated with higher energy Fig 118 shows the wave shapes of a loud and a soft sound of the same frequency The quality or timber of sound is that characteristic which enables us to distinguish one sound from another having the same pitch and loudness The sound which is more pleasant is said to be of a rich quality A sound of single frequency is called a tone The sound which is produced due to a mixture of several frequencies is called a note and is pleasant to listen to Noise is unpleasant to the ear Music is pleasant to hear and is of rich quality Here is the wavelength of the sound wave It is the distance travelled by the sound wave in one time period T of the wave Thus v or v That is
