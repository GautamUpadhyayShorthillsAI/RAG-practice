72a what does it mean What do you understand from the signboard in Fig 72b Different objects may take different amounts of time to cover a given distance Some of them move fast and some move slowly The rate at which objects move can be different Also different objects can move at the same rate One of the ways of measuring the rate of motion of an object is to find out the distance travelled by the object in unit time This quantity is referred to as speed The SI unit of speed is metre per second This is represented by the symbol m s1 or ms The other units of speed include centimetre per second cm s1 and kilometre per hour km h1 To specify the speed of an object we require only its magnitude The speed of an object need not be constant In most cases objects will be in nonuniform motion Therefore we describe the rate of motion of such objects in terms of their average speed The average speed of an object is obtained by dividing the total distance travelled by the total time taken That is
