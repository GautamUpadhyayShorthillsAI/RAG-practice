chamber the left ventricle relaxes so that the blood is transferred to it When the muscular left ventricle contracts in its turn the blood is pumped out to the body Deoxygenated blood comes from the body to the upper chamber on the right the right atrium as it relaxes As the right atrium contracts the corresponding lower chamber the right ventricle dilates This transfers blood to the right ventricle which in turn pumps it to the lungs for oxygenation Since ventricles have to pump blood into various organs they have thicker muscular walls than the atria do Valves ensure that blood does not flow backwards when the atria or ventricles contract Oxygen enters the blood in the lungs The separation of the right side and the left side of the heart is useful to keep oxygenated and de oxygenated blood from mixing Such separation allows a highly efficient supply of oxygen to the body This is useful in animals that have high energy needs such as birds and mammals which constantly use energy to
