mass numbers Therefore we can say that there are three isotopes of hydrogen atom namely protium deuterium and tritium Q X A Z 202425 STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM 45 Q Many elements consist of a mixture of isotopes Each isotope of an element is a pure substance The chemical properties of isotopes are similar but their physical properties are different Chlorine occurs in nature in two isotopic forms with masses 35 u and 37 u in the ratio of 31 Obviously the question arises what should we take as the mass of chlorine atom Let us find out The average atomic mass of chlorine atom on the basis of above data will be 35 75 100 37 25 100 105 4 37 4 142 4 35 5 u The mass of an atom of any natural element is taken as the average mass of all the naturally occuring atoms of that element If an element has no isotopes then the mass of its atom would be the same as the sum of protons and neutrons in it But if an element occurs in isotopic forms then we have to know the percentage of each isotopic form and
