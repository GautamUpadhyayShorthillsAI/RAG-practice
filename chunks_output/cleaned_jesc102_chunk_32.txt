is a mixture of baking soda sodium hydrogencarbonate and a mild edible acid such as tartaric acid When baking powder is heated or mixed in water the following reaction takes place NaHCO3 H CO2 H2O Sodium salt of acid From any acid Carbon dioxide produced during the reaction can cause bread or cake to rise making them soft and spongy ii Sodium hydrogencarbonate is also an ingredient in antacids Being alkaline it neutralises excess acid in the stomach and provides relief iii It is also used in sodaacid fire extinguishers Washing soda Another chemical that can be obtained from sodium chloride is Na2CO310H2O washing soda You have seen above that sodium carbonate can be obtained by heating baking soda recrystallisation of sodium carbonate gives washing soda It is also a basic salt Na CO H O Na CO H O Sodium carbonate 2 3 2 2 3 2 10 10 202425 Science 32 What does 10H2O signify Does it make Na2CO3 wet We will address this question in the next section Sodium carbonate and sodium
