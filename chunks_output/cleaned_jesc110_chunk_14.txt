102 Activity 102 Activity 102 Activity 102 Activity 102 n Take a thick sheet of cardboard and make a small hole or narrow slit in its middle n Allow sunlight to fall on the narrow slit This gives a narrow beam of white light n Now take a glass prism and allow the light from the slit to fall on one of its faces as shown in Fig 105 n Turn the prism slowly until the light that comes out of it appears on a nearby screen n What do you observe You will find a beautiful band of colours Why does this happen Here PE is the incident ray EF is the refracted ray and FS is the emergent ray You may note that a ray of light is entering from air to glass at the first surface AB The light ray on refraction has bent towards the normal At the second surface AC the light ray has entered from glass to air Hence it has bent away from normal Compare the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction at each refracting surface of the prism Is this similar to the kind of bending that occurs in a glass slab
