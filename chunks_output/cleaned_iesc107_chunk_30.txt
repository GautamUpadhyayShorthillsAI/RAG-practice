of the car is 1 m s 2 and the distance covered is 375 m Q 202425 MOTION 83 4 A racing car has a uniform acceleration of 4 m s2 What distance will it cover in 10 s after start 5 A stone is thrown in a vertically upward direction with a velocity of 5 m s1 If the acceleration of the stone during its motion is 10 m s2 in the downward direction what will be the height attained by the stone and how much time will it take to reach there 76 Uniform Circular Motion When the velocity of an object changes we say that the object is accelerating The change in the velocity could be due to change in its magnitude or the direction of the motion or both Can you think of an example when an object does not change its magnitude of velocity but only its direction of motion straight parts AB BC CD and DA of the track In order to keep himself on track he quickly changes his speed at the corners How many times will the athlete have to change his direction of motion while he completes one round It is clear
