down the value of focal length You can also find it out by obtaining image of a distant object on a sheet of paper n Mark a line on a Table with a chalk Place the concave mirror on a stand Place the stand over the line such that its pole lies over the line n Draw with a chalk two more lines parallel to the previous line such that the distance between any two successive lines is equal to the focal length of the mirror These lines will now correspond to the positions of the points P F and C respectively Remember For a spherical mirror of small aperture the principal focus F lies midway between the pole P and the centre of curvature C n Keep a bright object say a burning candle at a position far beyond C Place a paper screen and move it in front of the mirror till you obtain a sharp bright image of the candle flame on it n Observe the image carefully Note down its nature position and relative size with respect to the object size n Repeat the activity by placing the candle a just beyond C
