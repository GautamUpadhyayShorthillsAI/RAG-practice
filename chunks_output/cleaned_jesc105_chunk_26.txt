give three molecules of carbon dioxide The other product is water Since this process takes place in the presence of air oxygen it is called aerobic respiration The release of energy in this aerobic process is a lot greater than in the anaerobic process Sometimes when there is a lack of oxygen in our muscle cells another pathway for the breakdown of pyruvate is taken Here the pyruvate is converted into lactic acid which is also a threecarbon molecule This buildup of lactic acid in our muscles during sudden activity causes cramps Figure 58 Figure 58 Figure 58 Figure 58 Figure 58 Breakdown of glucose by various pathways The energy released during cellular respiration is immediately used to synthesise a molecule called ATP which is used to fuel all other activities in the cell In these processes ATP is broken down giving rise to a fixed amount of energy which can drive the endothermic reactions taking place in the cell ATP ATP is the energy currency for most cellular processes The energy
