no role to play the electrons move only if there is a difference of electric pressure called the potential difference along the conductor This difference of potential may be produced by a battery consisting of one or more electric cells The chemical action within a cell generates the potential difference across the terminals of the cell even when no current is drawn from it When the cell is connected to a conducting circuit element the potential difference sets the charges in motion in the conductor and produces an electric current In order to maintain the current in a given electric circuit the cell has to expend its chemical energy stored in it We define the electric potential difference between two points in an electric circuit carrying some current as the work done to move a unit charge from one point to the other Potential difference V between two points Work done WCharge Q V WQ 112 The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt V named after Alessandro Volta 1745 1827 an
