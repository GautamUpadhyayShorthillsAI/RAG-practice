eye lens or ii elongation of the eyeball This defect can be corrected by using a concave lens of suitable power This is illustrated in Fig 102 c A concave lens of suitable power will bring the image back on to the retina and thus the defect is corrected b Hypermetropia Hypermetropia is also known as farsightedness A person with hypermetropia can see distant objects clearly but cannot see nearby objects distinctly The near point for the person is farther away from the normal near point 25 cm Such a person has to keep a reading material much beyond 25 cm from the eye for comfortable reading This is because the light rays from a closeby object are focussed at a point behind the retina as shown in Fig 103 b This defect arises either because i the focal length of the eye lens is too long or ii the eyeball has become too small This defect can be corrected by using a convex lens of appropriate power This is illustrated in Fig 103 c Eyeglasses with converging lenses provide the additional
