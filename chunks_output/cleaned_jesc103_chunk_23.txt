up by chlorine After gaining an electron the chlorine atom gets a unit negative charge because its nucleus has 17 protons and there are 18 electrons in its K L and M shells This gives us a chloride anion C1 So both these elements can have a giveandtake relation between them as follows Fig 35 Na Na e 281 28 Sodium cation Cl e Cl 287 288 Chloride anion Figure 35 Figure 35 Figure 35 Figure 35 Figure 35 Formation of sodium chloride Sodium and chloride ions being oppositely charged attract each other and are held by strong electrostatic forces of attraction to exist as sodium chloride NaCl It should be noted that sodium chloride does not exist as molecules but aggregates of oppositely charged ions Let us see the formation of one more ionic compound magnesium chloride Fig 36 Table 33 Electronic configurations of some elements Type of Element Atomic Number of element number electrons in shells K L M N Noble gases Helium He 2 2 Neon Ne 10 2 8 Argon Ar 18 2 8 8 Metals Sodium Na 11 2 8 1
