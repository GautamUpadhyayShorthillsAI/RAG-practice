in hydrogen atom only one proton is present in the nucleus Similarly for carbon Z 6 Therefore the atomic number is defined as the total number of protons present in the nucleus of an atom 452 MASS NUMBER After studying the properties of the sub atomic particles of an atom we can conclude that mass of an atom is practically due to protons and neutrons alone These are present in the nucleus of an atom Hence protons and neutrons are also called nucleons Therefore the mass of an atom resides in its nucleus For example mass of carbon is 12 u because it has 6 protons and 6 neutrons 6 u 6 u 12 u Similarly the mass of aluminium is 27 u 13 protons14 neutrons The mass number is defined as the sum of the total number of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus of an atom It is denoted by A In the notation for an atom the atomic number mass number and symbol of the element are to be written as Mass Number Q Symbol of element Atomic Number For example nitrogen is written as 14 7 N uestions 1 If
