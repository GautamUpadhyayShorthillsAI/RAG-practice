image of an object 4 Why do we prefer a convex mirror as a rearview mirror in vehicles 923 Sign Convention for Reflection by Spherical Mirrors While dealing with the reflection of light by spherical mirrors we shall follow a set of sign conventions called the New Cartesian Sign Convention In this convention the pole P of the mirror is taken as the origin Fig 99 The principal axis of the mirror is taken as the xaxis XX of the coordinate system The conventions are as follows i The object is always placed to the left of the mirror This implies that the light from the object falls on the mirror from the lefthand side ii All distances parallel to the principal axis are measured from the pole of the mirror iii All the distances measured to the right of the origin along xaxis are taken as positive while those measured to the left of the origin along xaxis are taken as negative iv Distances measured perpendicular to and above the principal axis along yaxis are taken as positive v Distances
