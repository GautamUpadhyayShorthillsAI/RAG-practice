18 u b The molecular mass of HNO3 the atomic mass of H the atomic mass of N 3 the atomic mass of O 1 14 48 63 u 352 FORMULA UNIT MASS The formula unit mass of a substance is a sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a formula unit of a compound Formula unit mass is calculated in the same manner as we calculate the molecular mass The only difference is that c Formula of sodium nitrate Formula NaNO3 d Formula of calcium hydroxide Formula CaOH2 Note that the formula of calcium hydroxide is CaOH2 and not CaOH2 We use brackets when we have two or more of the same ions in the formula Here the bracket around OH with a subscript 2 indicates that there are two hydroxyl OH groups joined to one calcium atom In other words there are two atoms each of oxygen and hydrogen in calcium hydroxide e Formula of sodium carbonate Formula Na2CO3 In the above example brackets are not needed if there is only one ion present f Formula of ammonium sulphate Formula NH42SO4 Q uestions 1 Write down the formulae
