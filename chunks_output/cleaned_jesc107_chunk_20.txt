One solution that many multicellular organisms have found for the problem mentioned above is to have special lineages of cells in specialised organs in which only half the number of chromosomes and half the amount of DNA as compared to the non reproductive body cells This is achieved by a process of cell division called meiosis Thus when these germcells from two individuals combine during sexual reproduction to form a new individual it results in re establishment of the number of chromosomes and the DNA content in the new generation If the zygote is to grow and develop into an organism which has highly specialised tissues and organs then it has to have sufficient stores of energy for doing this In very simple organisms it is seen that the two germcells are not very different from one another or may even be similar But as the body designs become more complex the germcells also specialise One germcell is large and contains the foodstores while the other is smaller and likely to be
