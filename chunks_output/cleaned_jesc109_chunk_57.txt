image of a needle at a distance of 50 cm from it Where is the needle placed in front of the convex lens if the image is equal to the size of the object Also find the power of the lens 3 Find the power of a concave lens of focal length 2 m What you have learnt n Light seems to travel in straight lines n Mirrors and lenses form images of objects Images can be either real or virtual depending on the position of the object n The reflecting surfaces of all types obey the laws of reflection The refracting surfaces obey the laws of refraction n New Cartesian Sign Conventions are followed for spherical mirrors and lenses More to Know 202425 Light Reflection and Refraction 159 n Mirror formula 1 1 1 v u f gives the relationship between the objectdistance u imagedistance v and focal length f of a spherical mirror n The focal length of a spherical mirror is equal to half its radius of curvature n The magnification produced by a spherical mirror is the ratio of the height of the image to the
