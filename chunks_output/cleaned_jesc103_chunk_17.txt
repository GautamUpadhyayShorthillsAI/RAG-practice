not evolved when a metal reacts with nitric acid It is because HNO3 is a strong oxidising agent It oxidises the H2 produced to water and itself gets reduced to any of the nitrogen oxides N2O NO NO2 But magnesium Mg and manganese Mn react with very dilute HNO3 to evolve H2 gas You must have observed in Activity 311 that the rate of formation of bubbles was the fastest in the case of magnesium The reaction was also the most exothermic in this case The reactivity decreases in the order Mg Al Zn Fe In the case of copper no bubbles were seen and the temperature also remained unchanged This shows that copper does not react with dilute HCl Do You Know Aqua regia Latin for royal water is a freshly prepared mixture of concentrated hydrochloric acid and concentrated nitric acid in the ratio of 31 It can dissolve gold even though neither of these acids can do so alone Aqua regia is a highly corrosive fuming liquid It is one of the few reagents that is able to dissolve gold and platinum 324 How
