It indicates that the magnitude of the magnetic field produced at a given point increases as the current through the wire increases What happens to the deflection of the needle if the compass is moved away from the copper wire but the current through the wire remains the same To see this now place the compass at a farther point from the conducting wire say at point Q What change do you observe We see that the deflection in the needle decreases Thus the magnetic field produced by a given current in the conductor decreases as the distance from it increases From Fig 126 it can be noticed that the concentric circles representing the magnetic field around a currentcarrying straight wire become larger and larger as we move away from it 1222 RightHand Thumb Rule A convenient way of finding the direction of magnetic field associated with a currentcarrying conductor is given in Fig 127 n Connect the copper wire vertically between the points X and Y as shown in Fig 126 a in series with the
