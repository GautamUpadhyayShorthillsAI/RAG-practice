Activity 39 you must have observed that sodium is the most reactive of the samples of metals taken here The reaction of magnesium is less vigorous implying that it is not as reactive as sodium But burning in oxygen does not help us to decide about the reactivity of zinc iron copper or lead Let us see some more reactions to arrive at a conclusion about the order of reactivity of these metals 322 What happens when Metals react with Water Activity 310 Activity 310 Activity 310 Activity 310 Activity 310 CAUTION This Activity needs the teachers assistance n Collect the samples of the same metals as in Activity 39 n Put small pieces of the samples separately in beakers halffilled with cold water n Which metals reacted with cold water Arrange them in the increasing order of their reactivity with cold water n Did any metal produce fire on water n Does any metal start floating after some time n Put the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers halffilled with hot water n For the
