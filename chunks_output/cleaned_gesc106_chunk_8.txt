Normally we take in air through our nostrils When we inhale air it passes through our nostrils into the nasal cavity From the nasal cavity the air reaches our lungs through the windpipe Lungs are present in the chest cavity Fig 64 This cavity is surrounded by ribs on the sides A large muscular sheet called diaphragm forms the floor of the chest cavity Fig 64 Breathing involves the movement of the diaphragm and the rib cage During inhalation ribs move up and outwards and diaphragm moves down This movement increases space in our chest cavity and air rushes into the lungs The lungs get filled with air During exhalation ribs move down and inwards while diaphragm moves up to its former position This reduces the size of the chest cavity and air is pushed out of the lungs Fig 65 These movements in our body can be felt easily Take a On an average an adult human being at rest breathes in and out 1518 times in a minute During heavy exercise the breathing rate can increase upto 25 times per
