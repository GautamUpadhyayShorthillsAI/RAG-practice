this with the tracing of the leaf done in the beginning Fig 52 n What can you conclude about the presence of starch in various areas of the leaf i Absorption of light energy by chlorophyll ii Conversion of light energy to chemical energy and splitting of water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen iii Reduction of carbon dioxide to carbohydrates These steps need not take place one after the other immediately For example desert plants take up carbon dioxide at night and prepare an intermediate which is acted upon by the energy absorbed by the chlorophyll during the day Let us see how each of the components of the above reaction are necessary for photosynthesis If you carefully observe a crosssection of a leaf under the microscope shown in Fig 51 you will notice that some cells contain green dots These green dots are cell organelles called chloroplasts which contain chlorophyll Let us do an activity which demonstrates that chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis 202425 Life Processes
