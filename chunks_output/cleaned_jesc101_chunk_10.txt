examine the above balanced Eq 19 Does this equation tell us anything about the physical state of each reactant and product No information has been given in this equation about their physical states To make a chemical equation more informative the physical states of the reactants and products are mentioned along with their chemical formulae The gaseous liquid aqueous and solid states of reactants and products are represented by the notations g l aq and s respectively The word aqueous aq is written if the reactant or product is present as a solution in water The balanced Eq 19 becomes 3Fes 4H2Og Fe3O4s 4H2g 110 Note that the symbol g is used with H2O to indicate that in this reaction water is used in the form of steam Usually physical states are not included in a chemical equation unless it is necessary to specify them Sometimes the reaction conditions such as temperature pressure catalyst etc for the reaction are indicated above andor below the arrow in the equation For example COg 2H
