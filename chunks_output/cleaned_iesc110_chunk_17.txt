initial velocity u and final velocity v of an object moving with a uniform acceleration a and the displacement s is v2 u2 2a s This gives 2 2 v u s 2a 102 From section 94 we know F m a Thus using Eq 102 in Eq 101 we can write the work done by the force F as 2 2 v u W m a 2a or 1 2 2 2 W m v u 103 If the object is starting from its stationary position that is u 0 then 1 2 2 W m v 104 It is clear that the work done is equal to the change in the kinetic energy of an object If u 0 the work done will be 1 2 2 m v Thus the kinetic energy possessed by an object of mass m and moving with a uniform velocity v is 1 2 2 k E m v 105 Example 103 An object of mass 15 kg is moving with a uniform velocity of 4 m s1 What is the kinetic energy possessed by the object Solution Mass of the object m 15 kg velocity of the object v 4 m s1 From Eq 105 1 2 2 k E m v 1 2 15 kg 4 m s1 4 m s1 120 J The kinetic energy of the object is 120 J Example 104 What is the work to be done to increase the velocity of a car
