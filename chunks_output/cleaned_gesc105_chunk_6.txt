in the form of the following equation Magnesium oxide MgO Water H2O Magnesium hydroxide MgOH2 As you have already learnt in Chapter 4 magnesium hydroxide is a base So magnesium oxide is a new substance formed on burning of magnesium Magnesium hydroxide is another new The equations here are different from those in mathematics In equations of this kind the arrow implies becomes No attempt should be made to balance chemical equations at this stage Reprint 202425 SCIENCE 50 substance formed by mixing magnesium oxide with water Activity 57 To be demonstrated by the teacher Dissolve about a teaspoonful of copper sulphate blue vitriol or neela thotha in about half a cup of water in a glass tumbler or a beaker Add a few drops of dilute sulphuric acid to the solution You should get a blue coloured solution Save a small sample of the solution in a test tube or a small glass bottle Drop a nail or a used shaving blade into the remaining solution Wait for half an hour or so Observe the colour of
