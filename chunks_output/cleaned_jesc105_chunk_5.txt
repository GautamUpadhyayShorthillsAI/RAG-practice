some of the most common chemical means to breakdown molecules For this many organisms use oxygen sourced from outside the body The process of acquiring oxygen from outside the body and to use it in the process of breakdown of food sources for cellular needs is what we call respiration In the case of a singlecelled organism no specific organs for taking in food exchange of gases or removal of wastes may be needed because the entire surface of the organism is in contact with the environment But what happens when the body size of the organism increases and the body design becomes more complex In multicellular organisms all the cells may not be in direct contact with the surrounding environment Thus simple diffusion will not meet the requirements of all the cells We have seen previously how in multicellular organisms various body parts have specialised in the functions they perform We are familiar with the idea of these specialised tissues and with their organisation in the body of the
