in hypotonic media without bursting The nucleus in eukaryotes is separated from the cytoplasm by doublelayered membrane and it directs the life processes of the cell The ER functions both as a passageway for intracellular transport and as a manufacturing surface The Golgi apparatus consists of stacks of membranebound vesicles that function in the storage modification and packaging of substances manufactured in the cell Most plant cells have large membranous organelles called plastids which are of two typeschromoplasts and leucoplasts Fig 57 Mitosis Fig 58 Meiosis divides to form two identical daughter cells Fig 57 The daughter cells have the same number of chromosomes as mother cell It helps in growth and repair of tissues in organisms Specific cells of reproductive organs or tissues in animals and plants divide to form gametes which after fertilisation give rise to offspring They divide by a different process called meiosis which involves two consecutive divisions When a cell divides
