The SI unit of electric potential difference is volt V named after Alessandro Volta 1745 1827 an Italian physicist One volt is the potential difference between two points in a current carrying conductor when 1 joule of work is done to move a charge of 1 coulomb from one point to the other Therefore 1 volt 1 joule 1 coulomb 113 1 V 1 J C1 The potential difference is measured by means of an instrument called the voltmeter The voltmeter is always connected in parallel across the points between which the potential difference is to be measured Example 112 How much work is done in moving a charge of 2 C across two points having a potential difference 12 V Solution The amount of charge Q that flows between two points at potential difference V 12 V is 2 C Thus the amount of work W done in moving the charge from Eq 112 is 202425 Science 174 W VQ 12 V 2 C 24 J Q U E S T I O N S 113 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM 113 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM 113 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM 113 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM 113 CIRCUIT DIAGRAM We know that an
