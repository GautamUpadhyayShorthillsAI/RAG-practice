If the number of electrons in the outermost shell of an atom is close to its full capacity then valency is determined in a different way For example the fluorine atom has 7 electrons in the outermost shell and its valency could be 7 But it is easier for Name of Symbol Atomic Number Number Number Vale Element Number of of of ncy Protons Neutrons Electrons K L M N Hydrogen H 1 1 1 1 1 Helium He 2 2 2 2 2 0 Lithium Li 3 3 4 3 2 1 1 Beryllium Be 4 4 5 4 2 2 2 Boron B 5 5 6 5 2 3 3 Carbon C 6 6 6 6 2 4 4 Nitrogen N 7 7 7 7 2 5 3 Oxygen O 8 8 8 8 2 6 2 Fluorine F 9 9 10 9 2 7 1 Neon Ne 10 10 10 10 2 8 0 Sodium Na 11 11 12 11 2 8 1 1 Magnesium Mg 12 12 12 12 2 8 2 2 Aluminium Al 13 13 14 13 2 8 3 3 Silicon Si 14 14 14 14 2 8 4 4 Phosphorus P 15 15 16 15 2 8 5 35 Sulphur S 16 16 16 16 2 8 6 2 Chlorine Cl 17 17 18 17 2 8 7 1 Argon Ar 18 18 22 18 2 8 8 0 Distribution of Electrons 202425 SCIENCE 44 fluorine to gain one electron instead of losing seven electrons Hence its valency is determined by
