of the plant We have studied the structure of these tissues in detail in Class IX Transport of water In xylem tissue vessels and tracheids of the roots stems and leaves are interconnected to form a continuous system of waterconducting channels reaching all parts of the plant At the roots cells in contact with the soil actively take up ions This creates a difference in the concentration of these ions between the root and the soil Water therefore 202425 Life Processes 95 moves into the root from the soil to eliminate this difference This means that there is steady movement of water into root xylem creating a column of water that is steadily pushed upwards However this pressure by itself is unlikely to be enough to move water over the heights that we commonly see in plants Plants use another strategy to move water in the xylem upwards to the highest points of the plant body Activity 58 Activity 58 Activity 58 Activity 58 Activity 58 n Take two small pots of approximately the same size
