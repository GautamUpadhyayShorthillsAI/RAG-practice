n Put the metals that did not react with cold water in beakers halffilled with hot water n For the metals that did not react with hot water arrange the apparatus as shown in Fig 33 and observe their reaction with steam n Which metals did not react even with steam n Arrange the metals in the decreasing order of reactivity with water 202425 Metals and Nonmetals 43 Metals react with water and produce a metal oxide and hydrogen gas Metal oxides that are soluble in water dissolve in it to further form metal hydroxide But all metals do not react with water Metal Water Metal oxide Hydrogen Metal oxide Water Metal hydroxide Metals like potassium and sodium react violently with cold water In case of sodium and potassium the reaction is so violent and exothermic that the evolved hydrogen immediately catches fire 2Ks 2H2Ol 2KOHaq H2g heat energy 2Nas 2H2Ol 2NaOHaq H2g heat energy The reaction of calcium with water is less violent The heat evolved is not sufficient for the hydrogen to catch fire
