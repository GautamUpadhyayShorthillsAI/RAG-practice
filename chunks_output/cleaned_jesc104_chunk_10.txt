graphite is smooth and slippery Graphite is also a very good conductor of electricity unlike other nonmetals that you studied in the previous Chapter Diamonds can be synthesised by subjecting pure carbon to very high pressure and temperature These synthetic diamonds are small but are otherwise indistinguishable from natural diamonds Fullerenes form another class of carbon allotropes The first one to be identified was C60 which has carbon atoms arranged in the shape of a football Since this looked like the geodesic dome designed by the US architect Buckminster Fuller the molecule was named fullerene The structure of diamond The structure of C60 Buckminsterfullerene Q U E S T I O N S 1 What would be the electron dot structure of carbon dioxide which has the formula CO2 2 What would be the electron dot structure of a molecule of sulphur which is made up of eight atoms of sulphur Hint The eight atoms of sulphur are joined together in the form of a ring Figure 45 Figure 45 Figure 45 Figure
