Figure 132 Figure 132 Figure 132 Figure 132 Figure 132 Trophic levels 1311 Food Chains and Webs In Activity 134 we have formed a series of organisms feeding on one another This series or organisms taking part at various biotic levels form a food chain Fig 131 Each step or level of the food chain forms a trophic level The autotrophs or the producers are at the first trophic level They fix up the solar energy and make it available for heterotrophs or the consumers The herbivores or the primary consumers come at the second small carnivores or the secondary consumers at the third and larger carnivores or the tertiary consumers form the fourth trophic level Fig 132 We know that the food we eat acts as a fuel to provide us energy to do work Thus the interactions among various components of the environment involves flow of energy from one component of the system to another As we have studied the autotrophs capture the energy present in sunlight and convert it into chemical energy This energy
