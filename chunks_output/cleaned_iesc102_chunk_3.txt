C and D can take different amounts of copper sulphate and potassium permanganate or common salt sodium chloride and mix the given components to form a mixture Report the observations on the uniformity in colour and texture Groups A and B have obtained a mixture which has a uniform composition throughout Such mixtures are called homogeneous mixtures or solutions Some other examples of such mixtures are i salt dissolved in water and ii sugar dissolved in water Compare the How do we judge whether milk ghee butter salt spices mineral water or juice that we buy from the market are pure 2 IIIIISSSSS M M M M MATTER ATTER ATTER ATTER ATTER A A A A AROUND ROUND ROUND ROUND ROUND U U U U USSSSS P P P P PURE URE URE URE URE C hapter 202425 More to know colour of the solutions of the two groups Though both the groups have obtained copper sulphate solution but the intensity of colour of the solutions is different This shows that a homogeneous mixture can have a variable composition Groups C and D
