we have the magnitude of the force F applied by the brakes as mv ut On substituting the values we get F 1000 kg 0 30 m s14 s 7500 kg m s2 or 7500 N The negative sign tells us that the force exerted by the brakes is opposite to the direction of motion of the motorcar Example 84 A force of 5 N gives a mass m1 an acceleration of 10 m s2 and a mass m2 an acceleration of 20 m s2 What acceleration would it give if both the masses were tied together Solution From Eq 84 we have m1 Fa1 and m2 Fa2 Here a1 10 m s2 a2 20 m s2 and F 5 N Thus m1 5 N10 m s2 050 kg and m2 5 N20 m s2 025 kg If the two masses were tied together the total mass m would be m 050 kg 025 kg 075 kg The acceleration a produced in the combined mass by the 5 N force would be a Fm 5 N075 kg 667 m s2 Example 85 The velocitytime graph of a ball of mass 20 g moving along a straight line on a long table is given in Fig 89 Fig 89 How much force does the table exert on the ball to bring it to rest Solution The initial velocity of the
