From the last chapter we recall that all living organisms are made of cells In unicellular organisms a single cell performs all basic functions For example in Amoeba a single cell carries out movement intake of food gaseous exchange and excretion But in multi cellular organisms there are millions of cells Most of these cells are specialised to carry out specific functions Each specialised function is taken up by a different group of cells Since these cells carry out only a particular function they do it very efficiently In human beings muscle cells contract and relax to cause movement nerve cells carry messages blood flows to transport oxygen food hormones and waste material and so on In plants vascular tissues conduct food and water from one part of the plant to other parts So multicellular organisms show division of labour Cells specialising in one function are often grouped together in the body This means that a particular function is carried out by a cluster of cells at a definite
