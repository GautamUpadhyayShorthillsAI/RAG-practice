only at these points Depending on the region where they are present meristematic tissues are classified as apical lateral and intercalary Fig 62 New cells produced by meristem are initially like those of meristem itself but as they grow and mature their characteristics slowly change and they become differentiated as components of other tissues Fig 61 Growth of roots in onion bulbs Activity 61 Take two glass jars and fill them with water Now take two onion bulbs and place one on each jar as shown in Fig 61 Observe the growth of roots in both the bulbs for a few days Measure the length of roots on day 1 2 and 3 On day 4 cut the root tips of the onion bulb in jar 2 by about 1 cm After this observe the growth of roots in both the jars and measure their lengths each day for five more days and record the observations in tables like the table below Length Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Day 5 Jar 1 Jar 2 Q Apical meristem is present at the growing tips of stems and roots and increases the length of
