by the direction that a north pole placed at that point would take Field lines are shown closer together where the magnetic field is greater n A metallic wire carrying an electric current has associated with it a magnetic field The field lines about the wire consist of a series of concentric circles whose direction is given by the righthand rule n The pattern of the magnetic field around a conductor due to an electric current flowing through it depends on the shape of the conductor The magnetic field of a solenoid carrying a current is similar to that of a bar magnet n An electromagnet consists of a core of soft iron wrapped around with a coil of insulated copper wire n A currentcarrying conductor when placed in a magnetic field experiences a force If the direction of the field and that of the current are mutually perpendicular to each other then the force acting on the conductor will be perpendicular to both and will be given by Flemings lefthand rule n In our houses we receive AC
