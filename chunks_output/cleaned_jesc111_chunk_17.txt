key Note the current in the ammeter n Replace the nichrome wire by another nichrome wire of same thickness but twice the length that is 2l marked 2 in the Fig 115 n Note the ammeter reading n Now replace the wire by a thicker nichrome wire of the same length l marked 3 A thicker wire has a larger crosssectional area Again note down the current through the circuit n Instead of taking a nichrome wire connect a copper wire marked 4 in Fig 115 in the circuit Let the wire be of the same length and same area of crosssection as that of the first nichrome wire marked 1 Note the value of the current n Notice the difference in the current in all cases n Does the current depend on the length of the conductor n Does the current depend on the area of crosssection of the wire used 202425 Electricity 179 have very low resistivity in the range of 108 m to 106 m They are good conductors of electricity Insulators like rubber and glass have resistivity of the order of 1012 to 1017 m Both the resistance
