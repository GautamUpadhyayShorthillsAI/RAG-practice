can cover long distances Spores are asexual reproductive bodies Each spore is covered by a hard protective coat to withstand unfavourable conditions such as high temperature and low humidity So they can survive for a long time Under favourable conditions a spore germinates and develops into a new individual Plants such as moss and ferns Fig 88 also reproduce by means of spores 122 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION You have learnt earlier the structure of a flower You know that the flowers are the reproductive parts of a plant Stamens are the male reproductive part and pistil is the female reproductive part Fig 89 water and nutrients are available algae grow and multiply rapidly by fragmentation An alga breaks up into two or more fragments These fragments or pieces grow into new individuals Fig 86 This process continues and they cover a large area in a short period of time Fig 87 Reproduction through spore formation in fungus Spore formation In Chapter 1 you learnt that the fungi on a bread piece
