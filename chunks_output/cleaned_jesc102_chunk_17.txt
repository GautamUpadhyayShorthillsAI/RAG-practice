process n Repeat the above Activity with sodium hydroxide pellets and record your observations Figure 25 Figure 25 Figure 25 Figure 25 Figure 25 Warning sign displayed on containers containing concentrated acids and bases The process of dissolving an acid or a base in water is a highly exothermic one Care must be taken while mixing concentrated nitric acid or sulphuric acid with water The acid must always be added slowly to water with constant stirring If water is added to a concentrated acid the heat generated may cause the mixture to splash out and cause burns The glass container may also break due to excessive local heating Look out for the warning sign shown in Fig 25 on the can of concentrated sulphuric acid and on the bottle of sodium hydroxide pellets Mixing an acid or base with water results in decrease in the concentration of ions H3OOH per unit volume Such a process is called dilution and the acid or the base is said to be diluted 202425 Acids Bases and Salts 25 23 HOW
