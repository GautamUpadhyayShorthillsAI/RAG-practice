POTENTIAL ENERGY Activity 108 Take a rubber band Hold it at one end and pull from the other The band stretches Release the band at one of the ends What happens The band will tend to regain its original length Obviously the band had acquired energy in its stretched position How did it acquire energy when stretched Activity 109 Take a slinky as shown below Ask a friend to hold one of its ends You hold the other end and move away from your friend Now you release the slinky Activity 1011 Lift an object through a certain height The object can now do work It begins to fall when released This implies that it has acquired some energy If raised to a greater height it can do more work and hence possesses more energy From where did it get the energy Think and discuss In the above situations the energy gets stored due to the work done on the object The energy transferred to an object is stored as potential energy if it is not used to cause a change in the velocity or speed of the object You
