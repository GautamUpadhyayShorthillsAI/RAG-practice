be perpendicular to both and will be given by Flemings lefthand rule n In our houses we receive AC electric power of 220 V with a frequency of 50 Hz One of the wires in this supply is with red insulation called live wire The other one is of black insulation which is a neutral wire The potential difference between the two is 220 V The third is the earth wire that has green insulation and this is connected to a metallic body deep inside earth It is used as a safety measure to ensure that any leakage of current to a metallic body does not give any severe shock to a user n Fuse is the most important safety device used for protecting the circuits due to shortcircuiting or overloading of the circuits 202425 Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 207 E X E R C I S E S 1 Which of the following correctly describes the magnetic field near a long straight wire a The field consists of straight lines perpendicular to the wire b The field consists of straight lines parallel to the wire c The field
