sketch of Bohrs model of an atom with three shells 4 What do you think would be the observation if the particle scattering experiment is carried out using a foil of a metal other than gold 424 NEUTRONS In 1932 J Chadwick discovered another sub atomic particle which had no charge and a mass nearly equal to that of a proton It was eventually named as neutron Neutrons are present in the nucleus of all atoms except hydrogen In general a neutron is represented as n The mass of an atom is therefore given by the sum of the masses of protons and neutrons present in the nucleus uestions 1 Name the three subatomic particles of an atom 2 Helium atom has an atomic mass of 4 u and two protons in its nucleus How many neutrons does it have 43 How are Electrons Distributed in Different Orbits Shells The distribution of electrons into different orbits of an atom was suggested by Bohr and Bury The following rules are followed for writing the number of electrons in different energy levels or shells i
