is negligibly small compared to that of the earth So we do not see the earth moving towards the apple Extend the same argument for why the earth does not move towards the moon In our solar system all the planets go around the Sun By arguing the same way we can say that there exists a force between the Sun and the planets From the above facts Newton concluded that not only does the earth attract an apple and the moon but all objects in the universe attract each other This force of attraction between objects is called the gravitational force G 2 Mm F d Fig 92 The gravitational force between two uniform objects is directed along the line joining their centres Let two objects A and B of masses M and m lie at a distance d from each other as shown in Fig 92 Let the force of attraction between two objects be F According to the universal law of gravitation the force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses That is FM m 91 And the force between two objects is
