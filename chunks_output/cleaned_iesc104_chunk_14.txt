electrons From the BohrBury scheme we also know that the outermost shell of an atom can Activity 42 Make a static atomic model displaying electronic configuration of the first eighteen elements Fig44 Schematic atomic structure of the first eighteen elements Q accommodate a maximum of 8 electrons It was observed that the atoms of elements completely filled with 8 electrons in the outermost shell show little chemical activity In other words their combining capacity or valency is zero Of these inert elements the 202425 STRUCTURE OF THE ATOM 43 Table 41 Composition of Atoms of the First Eighteen Elements with Electron Distribution in Various Shells helium atom has two electrons in its outermost shell and all other elements have atoms with eight electrons in the outermost shell The combining capacity of the atoms of elements that is their tendency to react and form molecules with atoms of the same or different elements was thus explained as an attempt to attain a fullyfilled outermost
