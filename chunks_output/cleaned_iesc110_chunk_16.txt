British physicist He is best known for his research in electricity and thermodynamics Amongst other things he formulated a law for the heating effect of electric current He also verified experimentally the law of conservation of energy and discovered the value of the mechanical equivalent of heat The unit of energy and work called joule is named after him James Prescott Joule 1818 1889 202425 SCIENCE 118 Let us now express the kinetic energy of an object in the form of an equation Consider an object of mass m moving with a uniform velocity u Let it now be displaced through a distance s when a constant force F acts on it in the direction of its displacement From Eq 101 the work done W is F s The work done on the object will cause a change in its velocity Let its velocity change from u to v Let a be the acceleration produced We studied three equations of motion The relation connecting the initial velocity u and final velocity v of an object moving with a uniform acceleration a and the
