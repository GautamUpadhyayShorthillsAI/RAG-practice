current in the conductor In a torch we know that the cells or a battery when placed in proper order provide flow of charges or an electric current through the torch bulb to glow We have also seen that the torch gives light only when its switch is on What does a switch do A switch makes a conducting link between the cell and the bulb A continuous and closed path of an electric current is called an electric circuit Now if the circuit is broken anywhere or the switch of the torch is turned off the current stops flowing and the bulb does not glow How do we express electric current Electric current is expressed by the amount of charge flowing through a particular area in unit time In other words it is the rate of flow of electric charges In circuits using metallic wires electrons constitute the flow of charges However electrons were not known at the time when the phenomenon of electricity was first observed So electric current was considered to be the flow of positive charges and the
