to the principal axis are falling on a convex lens These rays after refraction from the lens are converging to a point on the principal axis This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the lens Let us see now the action of a concave lens Observe Fig912 b carefully Several rays of light parallel to the principal axis are falling on a concave lens These rays after refraction from the lens are appearing to diverge from a point on the principal axis This point on the principal axis is called the principal focus of the concave lens If you pass parallel rays from the opposite surface of the lens you get another principal focus on the opposite side Letter F is usually used to represent principal focus However a lens has two principal foci They are represented by F1 and F2 The distance of the principal focus from the optical centre of a lens is called its focal length The letter f is used to represent the focal length How can you find the focal length of a convex lens
