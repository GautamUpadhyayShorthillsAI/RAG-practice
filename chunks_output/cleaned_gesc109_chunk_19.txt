the positive values on the xaxis along OX Similarly positive values on the yaxis are shown along OY In this chapter we shall consider only the positive values of quantities Therefore we shall use only the shaded part of the graph shown in Fig 911 Boojho and Paheli found out the distance travelled by a car and the time taken by it to cover that distance Their data is shown in Table 96 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 20 10 30 40 50 60 70 80 Weight in kg Age in year X O X Y Y You can make the graph by following the steps given below Draw two perpendicular lines to represent the two axes and mark them as OX and OY as in Fig 911 Decide the quantity to be shown along the xaxis and that to be shown along the yaxis In this case Y X Other gases Oxygen Nitrogen Reprint 202425 SCIENCE 102 we show the time along the xaxis and the distance along the yaxis Choose a scale to represent the distance and another to represent the time on the graph For the motion of the car scales could be Time 1 min 1 cm
