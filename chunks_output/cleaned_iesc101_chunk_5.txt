does it take for the colour of ink to spread evenly throughout the water Activity Activity Activity Activity Activity 15 15 15 15 15 Drop a crystal of copper sulphate or potassium permanganate into a glass of hot water and another containing cold water Do not stir the solution Allow the crystals to settle at the bottom What do you observe just above the solid crystal in the glass What happens as time passes What does this suggest about the particles of solid and liquid Does the rate of mixing change with temperature Why and how From the above three activities 13 14 and 15 we can conclude the following Fig 12 Estimating how small are the particles of matter With every dilution though the colour becomes light it is still visible This experiment shows that just a few crystals of potassium permanganate can colour a large volume of water about 1000 L So we conclude that there must be millions of tiny particles in just one crystal of potassium permanganate which keep on dividing themselves
