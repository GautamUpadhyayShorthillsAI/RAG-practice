atoms of sulphur are joined together in the form of a ring Figure 45 Figure 45 Figure 45 Figure 45 Figure 45 Electron dot structure for methane points of these compounds Since the electrons are shared between atoms and no charged particles are formed such covalent compounds are generally poor conductors of electricity Allotropes of carbon The element carbon occurs in different forms in nature with widely varying physical properties Both diamond and graphite are formed by carbon atoms the difference lies in the manner in which the carbon atoms are bonded to one another In diamond each carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms forming a rigid threedimensional structure In graphite each carbon atom is bonded to three other carbon atoms in the same plane giving a hexagonal array One of these bonds is a doublebond and thus the valency of carbon is satisfied Graphite structure is formed by the hexagonal arrays being placed in layers one above the other More to Know The structure of
