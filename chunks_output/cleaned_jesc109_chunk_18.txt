the results in a convenient format Uses of concave mirrors Concave mirrors are commonly used in torches searchlights and vehicles headlights to get powerful parallel beams of light They are often used as shaving mirrors to see a larger image of the face The dentists use concave mirrors to see large images of the teeth of patients Large concave mirrors are used to concentrate sunlight to produce heat in solar furnaces b Image formation by a Convex Mirror We studied the image formation by a concave mirror Now we shall study the formation of image by a convex mirror 202425 Light Reflection and Refraction 141 We consider two positions of the object for studying the image formed by a convex mirror First is when the object is at infinity and the second position is when the object is at a finite distance from the mirror The ray diagrams for the formation of image by a convex mirror for these two positions of the object are shown in Fig98 a and b respectively The results are summarised in
