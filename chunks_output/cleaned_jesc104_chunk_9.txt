CH4 Hydrogen as you know has a valency of 1 Carbon is tetravalent because it has four valence electrons In order to achieve noble gas configuration carbon shares these electrons with four atoms of hydrogen as shown in Fig 45 Such bonds which are formed by the sharing of an electron pair between two atoms are known as covalent bonds Covalently bonded molecules are seen to have strong bonds within the molecule but inter molecular forces are weak This gives rise to the low melting and boiling Figure 41 Figure 41 Figure 41 Figure 41 Figure 41 A molecule of hydrogen Figure 42 Figure 42 Figure 42 Figure 42 Figure 42 Single bond between two hydrogen atoms 202425 Carbon and its Compounds 61 These two different structures result in diamond and graphite having very different physical properties even though their chemical properties are the same Diamond is the hardest substance known while graphite is smooth and slippery Graphite is also a very good conductor of electricity unlike other
