fluorine to gain one electron instead of losing seven electrons Hence its valency is determined by subtracting seven electrons from the octet and this gives you a valency of one for fluorine Valency can be calculated in a similar manner for oxygen What is the valency of oxygen that you get from this calculation Therefore an atom of each element has a definite combining capacity called its valency Valency of the first eighteen elements is given in the last column of Table 41 uestion 1 How will you find the valency of chlorine sulphur and magnesium 45 Atomic Number and Mass Number 451 ATOMIC NUMBER We know that protons are present in the nucleus of an atom It is the number of protons of an atom which determines its atomic number It is denoted by Z All atoms of an element have the same atomic number Z In fact elements are defined by the number of protons they possess For hydrogen Z 1 because in hydrogen atom only one proton is present in the nucleus Similarly for carbon Z 6 Therefore the
