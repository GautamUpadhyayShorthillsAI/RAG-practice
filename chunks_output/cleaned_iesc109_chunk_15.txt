the mass of an object is constant and does not change from place to place 94 Weight We know that the earth attracts every object with a certain force and this force depends on the mass m of the object and the acceleration due to the gravity g The weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth We know that F m a 913 that is F m g 914 The force of attraction of the earth on an object is known as the weight of the object It is denoted by W Substituting the same in Eq 914 we have W m g 915 As the weight of an object is the force with which it is attracted towards the earth the SI unit of weight is the same as that of force that is newton N The weight is a force acting vertically downwards it has both magnitude and direction We have learnt that the value of g is constant at a given place Therefore at a given place the weight of an object is directly proportional to the mass say m of the object that is W m It is due to this reason that at a given place we can
