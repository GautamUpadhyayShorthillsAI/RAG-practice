you may note the time when the bob is at one of its extreme positions Measure the time the pendulum takes to complete 20 oscillations Record your observations Fig 94 b Different positions of the bob of an oscillating simple pendulum Fig 94 a A simple pendulum to A to B and back to O The pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves from one extreme position A to the other extreme position B and comes back to A The time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation is called its time period Activity 92 Set up a simple pendulum as shown in Fig 94 a with a thread or string of length nearly one metre Switch off any fans nearby Let the bob of the pendulum come to rest at its mean position Mark the mean position of the bob on the floor below it or on the wall behind it To measure the time period of the pendulum we will need a stopwatch However if a stopwatch is not available a table clock or a wristwatch can be used A O B Reprint 202425 SCIENCE 96 Table 92 Time period of a
