a very few iron filings stick at the remaining part of the magnet Fig 44 Iron filings sticking to a bar magnet Do all parts of a magnet attract magnetic materials equally If we repeat this activity with magnets of other shapes do we get the same result Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 6 64 If we have noticed the direction where the Sun rises or sets we have an approximate idea of where East or West is Hence we can locate the direction along which the magnet rests These ends of the magnet are called the two poles of the magnetthe North pole and the South pole Most of the iron filings stick to the poles of a magnet of any shape It is not possible to obtain a magnet with a single pole If a magnet is broken into smaller pieces North and South poles always exist in pairs even in the smallest piece of the magnet A single North pole or a South pole cannot exist 43 Finding Directions Activity 43 Let us experiment Suspend a bar magnet with a thread tied to the middle of the magnet as shown
