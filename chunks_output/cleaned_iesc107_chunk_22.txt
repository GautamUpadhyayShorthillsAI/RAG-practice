will not change with time Fig 75 It will be a straight line parallel to the xaxis Fig 75 shows the velocitytime graph for a car moving with uniform velocity of 40 km h1 We know that the product of velocity and time give displacement of an object moving with uniform velocity The area enclosed by velocitytime graph and the time axis will be equal to the magnitude of the displacement To know the distance moved by the car between time t1 and t2 using Fig 75 draw perpendiculars from the points corresponding to the time t1 and t2 on the graph The velocity of 40 km h1 is represented by the height AC or BD and the time t2 t1 is represented by the length AB So the distance s moved by the car in time t2 t1 can be expressed as s AC CD 40 km h1 t2 t1 h 40 t2 t1 km area of the rectangle ABDC shaded in Fig 75 We can also study about uniformly accelerated motion by plotting its velocity time graph Consider a car being driven along a straight road for testing its engine Suppose a person sitting next
