to the inside a process we commonly call nutrition If the body size of the organisms is to grow additional raw material will also be needed from outside Since life on earth depends on carbon based molecules most of these food sources are also carbonbased Depending on the complexity of these carbon sources different organisms can then use different kinds of nutritional processes The outside sources of energy could be quite varied since the environment is not under the control of the individual organism These sources of energy therefore need to be broken down or built up in the body and must be finally converted to a uniform source of energy that can be used for the various molecular movements needed for maintaining living structures as well as to the kind of molecules the body needs to grow For this a series of chemical reactions in the body are necessary Oxidisingreducing reactions are some of the most common chemical means to breakdown molecules For this many organisms use oxygen
