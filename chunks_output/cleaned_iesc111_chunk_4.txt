but the disturbance is carried forward This is what happens during propagation of sound in a medium hence sound can be visualised as a wave Sound waves are characterised by the motion of particles in the medium and are called mechanical waves Air is the most common medium through which sound travels When a vibrating object moves forward it pushes and compresses the air in front of it creating a region of high pressure This region is called a compression C as shown in Fig 114 This compression starts to move away from the vibrating object When the vibrating object moves backwards it creates a region of low pressure called rarefaction R as shown in Fig 114 As the object moves back and forth rapidly a series of compressions and rarefactions is created in the air These make the sound wave that Fig 113 Both the prongs of the vibrating tuning fork dipped in water From the above activities what do you conclude Can you produce sound without a vibrating object In the above activities we have
