with either a prefix or a suffix as given in Table 44 iii If the name of the functional group is to be given as a suffix and the suffix of the functional group begins with a vowel a e i o u then the name of the carbon chain is modified by deleting the final e and adding the appropriate suffix For example a threecarbon chain with a ketone group would be named in the following manner Propane e propan one propanone iv If the carbon chain is unsaturated then the final ane in the name of the carbon chain is substituted by ene or yne as given in Table 44 For example a threecarbon chain with a double bond would be called propene and if it has a triple bond it would be called propyne n Calculate the difference in the formulae and molecular masses for a CH3OH and C2H5OH b C2H5OH and C3H7OH and c C3H7OH and C4H9OH n Is there any similarity in these three n Arrange these alcohols in the order of increasing carbon atoms to get a family Can we call this family a homologous series n Generate the
