and water into water vapour we have to supply heat to it If we want to change water into ice what should be done It can be done by placing water in a cold environment such as a freezer Water freezes and is converted into ice If we take the ice out of the freezer it melts and is converted into water Can you think of any other example besides water that can change from solid to liquid A candle which is made of wax is one such example How can we turn candle wax into liquid state How can we change the liquid wax back into solid state We should cool the liquid wax to change it into a solid What are the other liquids you have seen which get converted into a solid Have you ever seen coconut oil getting converted into its solid state during the winter season Hence we can see that water and other substances change their states on heating or cooling The process of conversion of a solid into liquid state is called melting The process of conversion of liquid into solid state is called freezing
