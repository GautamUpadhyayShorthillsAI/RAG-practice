a sharp shadow of an opaque object points to this straightline path of light usually indicated as a ray of light More to Know If an opaque object on the path of light becomes very small light has a tendency to bend around it and not walk in a straight line an effect known as the diffraction of light Then the straightline treatment of optics using rays fails To explain phenomena such as diffraction light is thought of as a wave the details of which you will study in higher classes Again at the beginning of the 20th century it became known that the wave theory of light often becomes inadequate for treatment of the interaction of light with matter and light often behaves somewhat like a stream of particles This confusion about the true nature of light continued for some years till a modern quantum theory of light emerged in which light is neither a wave nor a particle the new theory reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature In this Chapter we shall study the
