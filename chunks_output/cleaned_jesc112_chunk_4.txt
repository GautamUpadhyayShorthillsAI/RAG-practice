needle get deflected when brought near a bar magnet Activity 122 Activity 122 Activity 122 Activity 122 Activity 122 n Fix a sheet of white paper on a drawing board using some adhesive material n Place a bar magnet in the centre of it n Sprinkle some iron filings uniformly around the bar magnet Fig 122 A saltsprinkler may be used for this purpose n Now tap the board gently n What do you observe Figure 122 Figure 122 Figure 122 Figure 122 Figure 122 Iron filings near the bar magnet align themselves along the field lines The iron filings arrange themselves in a pattern as shown Fig 122 Why do the iron filings arrange in such a pattern What does this pattern demonstrate The magnet exerts its influence in the region surrounding it Therefore the iron filings experience a force The force thus exerted makes iron filings to arrange in a pattern The region surrounding a magnet in which the force of the magnet can be detected is said to have a magnetic field The lines along which the iron
