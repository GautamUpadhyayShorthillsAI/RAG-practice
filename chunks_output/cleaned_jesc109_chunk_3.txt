reconciles the particle properties of light with the wave nature In this Chapter we shall study the phenomena of reflection and refraction of light using the straightline propagation of light These basic concepts will help us in the study of some of the optical phenomena in nature We shall try to understand in this Chapter the reflection of light by spherical mirrors and refraction of light and their application in real life situations 91 REFLECTION OF LIGHT 91 REFLECTION OF LIGHT 91 REFLECTION OF LIGHT 91 REFLECTION OF LIGHT 91 REFLECTION OF LIGHT A highly polished surface such as a mirror reflects most of the light falling on it You are already familiar with the laws of reflection of light 202425 Light Reflection and Refraction 135 Let us recall these laws i The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection and ii The incident ray the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane These laws of reflection are applicable to all
