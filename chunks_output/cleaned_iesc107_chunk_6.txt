C through A The shortest distance measured from the initial to the final position of an object is known as the displacement Can the magnitude of the displacement be equal to the distance travelled by an object Consider the example given in Fig 71 For motion of the object from O to A the distance covered is 60 km and the magnitude of displacement is also 60 km During its motion from O to A and back to B the distance covered Fig 71 Positions of an object on a straight line path 60 km 25 km 85 km while the magnitude of displacement 35 km Thus the magnitude of displacement 35 km is not equal to the path length 85 km Further we will notice that the magnitude of the displacement for a course of motion may be zero but the corresponding distance covered is not zero If we consider the object to travel back to O the final position concides with the initial position and therefore the displacement is zero However the distance covered in this journey is OA AO 60 km 60 km 120 km Thus two different
