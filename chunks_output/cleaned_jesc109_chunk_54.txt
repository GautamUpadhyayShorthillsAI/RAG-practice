The image is real and inverted Magnification m h v h u or h h vu Height of the image h 20 3015 40 cm Magnification m vu or 30cm 2 15cm m The negative signs of m and h show that the image is inverted and real It is formed below the principal axis Thus a real inverted image 4 cm tall is formed at a distance of 30 cm on the other side of the lens The image is two times enlarged 938 Power of a Lens You have already learnt that the ability of a lens to converge or diverge light rays depends on its focal length For example a convex lens of short focal length bends the light rays through large angles by focussing them closer to the optical centre Similarly concave lens of very short focal length causes higher divergence than the one with longer focal length The degree of convergence or divergence of light rays achieved by a lens is expressed in terms of its power The power of a lens is defined as the reciprocal of its focal length It is represented by the letter P The power P of a lens of
