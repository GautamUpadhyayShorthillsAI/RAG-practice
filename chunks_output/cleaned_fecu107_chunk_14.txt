It is therefore always necessary to look carefully at the thermometer you are about to use You have learnt how to find the temperature range of a given laboratory thermometer You have also learnt how to find the smallest value that a given laboratory thermometer can read We will now learn how to measure temperature using a laboratory thermometer But let us first learn how to use a laboratory thermometer correctly Fig 73b Closeup of a part of the thermometer shown in Fig 73a Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 6 132 Correct way of measuring temperature using a laboratory thermometer When the thermometer is immersed in water its bulb should not touch the bottom or the sides of the beaker The thermometer should be held vertically Fig 74 It should not be tilted The temperature must be read while the thermometer is immersed in water While reading the thermometer the eye Activity 75 Let us measure Take some warm water in a beaker Dip the thermometer in water so that the bulb is immersed in
