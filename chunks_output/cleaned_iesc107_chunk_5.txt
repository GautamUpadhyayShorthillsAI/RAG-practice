device that shows the distance travelled Such a device is known as an odometer A car is driven from Bhubaneshwar to New Delhi The difference between the final reading and the initial reading of the odometer is 1850 km Find the magnitude of the displacement between Bhubaneshwar and New Delhi by using the Road Map of India The total path length covered by the object is OA AC that is 60 km 35 km 95 km This is the distance covered by the object To describe distance we need to specify only the numerical value and not the direction of motion There are certain quantities which are described by specifying only their numerical values The numerical value of a physical quantity is its magnitude From this example can you find out the distance of the final position C of the object from the initial position O This difference will give you the numerical value of the displacement of the object from O to C through A The shortest distance measured from the initial to the final position of an object is
