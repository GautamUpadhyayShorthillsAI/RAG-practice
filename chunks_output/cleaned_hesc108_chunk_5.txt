whom the pair of girls in Fig 83 b are trying to pull each other Similarly the cow and the man in Fig 83 c appear to pull each other The girls in the two situations shown here are applying force on each other Is it also true for the man and the cow From these examples we can infer that at least two objects must interact for a force to come into play Thus an interaction of one object with another object results in a force between the two objects 202425 SCIENCE 96 Does it mean that the net force on an object is zero if the two forces acting on it in opposite directions are equal rope in their direction Sometimes the rope simply does not move Is it not similar to the situation shown in Fig 83 b The team that pulls harder that is applies a larger force finally wins the game What do these examples suggest about the nature of force Forces applied on an object in the same direction add to one another Now recall what happened when you and your friend pushed the heavy box in the same direction
