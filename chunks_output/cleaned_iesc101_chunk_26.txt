are particles with different amounts of kinetic energy In the case of liquids a small fraction of particles at the surface having higher kinetic energy is able to break away from the forces of attraction of other particles and gets converted into vapour This phenomenon of change of liquid into vapours at any temperature below its boiling point is called evaporation 151 FACTORS AFFECTING EVAPORATION Let us understand this with an activity Activity 114 Take 5 mL of water in a test tube and keep it near a window or under a fan Take 5 mL of water in an open china dish and keep it near a window or under a fan Take 5 mL of water in an open china Q 202425 SCIENCE 10 What you have learnt Matter is made up of small particles The matter around us exists in three statessolid liquid and gas The forces of attraction between the particles are maximum in solids intermediate in liquids and minimum in gases The spaces in between the constituent particles and kinetic energy of the particles are minimum
