of the battery d The process of depositing a layer of any desired metal on another material by means of electricity is called 2 When the free ends of a tester are dipped into a solution the magnetic needle shows deflection Can you explain the reason 3 Name three liquids which when tested in the manner shown in Fig119 may cause the magnetic needle to deflect Fig 119 202425 CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC CURRENT 147 4 The bulb does not glow in the setup shown in Fig1110 List the possible reasons Explain your answer Fig 1110 5 A tester is used to check the conduction of electricity through two liquids labelled A and B It is found that the bulb of the tester glows brightly for liquid A while it glows very dimly for liquid B You would conclude that i liquid A is a better conductor than liquid B ii liquid B is a better conductor than liquid A iii both liquids are equally conducting iv conducting properties of liquid cannot be compared in this manner 6 Does pure water conduct electricity If
