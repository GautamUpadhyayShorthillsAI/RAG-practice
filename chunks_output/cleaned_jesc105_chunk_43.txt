because of changes in plant body design diffusion processes will not be sufficient to provide raw material in leaves and energy in roots A proper system of transportation is therefore essential in such situations Energy needs differ between different body designs Plants do not move and plant bodies have a large proportion of dead cells in many tissues As a result plants have low energy needs and can use relatively slow transport systems The distances over which transport systems have to operate however can be very large in plants such as very tall trees Plant transport systems will move energy stores from leaves and raw materials from roots These two pathways are constructed as independently organised conducting tubes One the xylem moves water and minerals obtained from the soil The other phloem transports products of photosynthesis from the leaves where they are synthesised to other parts of the plant We have studied the structure of these tissues in detail in Class IX Transport of
