Rutherford was interested in knowing how the electrons are arranged within an atom Rutherford designed an experiment for this In this experiment fast moving alpha particles were made to fall on a thin gold foil He selected a gold foil because he wanted as thin a layer as possible This gold foil was about 1000 atoms thick particles are doublycharged helium ions Since they have a mass of 4 u the fastmoving particles have a considerable amount of energy It was expected that particles would be deflected by the subatomic particles in the gold atoms Since the particles were much heavier than the protons he did not expect to see large deflections Q Fig41 Thomsons model of an atom JJ Thomson 1856 1940 a British physicist was born in Cheetham Hill a suburb of Manchester on 18 December 1856 He was awarded the Nobel prize in Physics in 1906 for his work on the discovery of electrons He directed the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge for 35 years and seven of his research assistants subsequently
