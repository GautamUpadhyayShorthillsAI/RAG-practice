is called oscillatory motion Fig 516 Oscillatory motion Fig 515 Circular motion Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 6 94 Activity 56 Let us investigate Take a thin metal strip of about 50 cm long Hold its one end pressed to a table You may use a few books or a brick to hold it Fig 517 Press the free end of the strip slightly and let it go Observe the motion of this end of the strip Does it move up and down This is also an example of oscillatory motion Fig 517 Oscillatory motion of a metal strip Activity 57 Let us identify Look at the picture of a childrens park Fig 518 or visit a childrens park Observe different kinds of motions Classify them as linear circular or oscillatory motion List them in Table 54 Give your justification for why you put each in a certain category If an object repeats its path after a fixed interval of time its motion is said to be periodic When an object is in circular motion it moves along the circular path again and again An object in oscillatory motion also
