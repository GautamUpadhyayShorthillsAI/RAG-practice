43 Let us experiment Suspend a bar magnet with a thread tied to the middle of the magnet as shown in Fig 45 You may need to adjust the position of the string till the magnet is balanced horizontally Now rotate the magnet gently in the horizontal direction and let it come to rest Mark the position corresponding to the ends of the magnet on the ground or on a piece of paper stuck to the ground Join these two points on the ground with a line This line indicates the direction along which the magnet comes to rest Now again rotate the magnet by giving a gentle push at its one end and wait till it comes to rest Does the magnet rest along the same line Fig 45 A freely suspended bar magnet Can we find a magnet with a single pole What direction does this line indicate along which the magnet rests How can we find it out Exploring Magnets 65 A freely suspended magnet comes to rest along the northsouth direction The end of the magnet that points towards north direction is called the Northseeking
