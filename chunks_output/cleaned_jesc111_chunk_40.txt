made of a metal or an alloy of appropriate melting point for example aluminium copper iron lead etc If a current larger than the specified value flows through the circuit the temperature of the fuse wire increases This melts the fuse wire and breaks the circuit The fuse wire is usually encased in a cartridge of porcelain or similar material with metal ends The fuses used for domestic purposes are rated as 1 A 2 A 3 A 5 A 10 A etc For an electric iron which consumes 1 kW electric power when operated at 220 V a current of 1000220 A that is 454 A will flow in the circuit In this case a 5 A fuse must be used Q U E S T I O N S 1 Why does the cord of an electric heater not glow while the heating element does 2 Compute the heat generated while transferring 96000 coulomb of charge in one hour through a potential difference of 50 V 3 An electric iron of resistance 20 takes a current of 5 A Calculate the heat developed in 30 s 202425 Electricity 191 118 ELECTRIC POWER 118 ELECTRIC POWER 118
