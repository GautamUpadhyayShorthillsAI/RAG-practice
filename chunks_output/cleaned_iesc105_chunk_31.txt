are formed in organisms in order to grow to replace old dead and injured cells and to form gametes required for reproduction The process by which new cells are made is called cell division There are two main types of cell division mitosis and meiosis The process of cell division by which most of the cells divide for growth is called mitosis In this process each cell called mother cell Q 202425 SCIENCE 58 What you have learnt The fundamental organisational unit of life is the cell Cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane composed of lipids and proteins The cell membrane is an active part of the cell It regulates the movement of materials between the ordered interior of the cell and the outer environment In plant cells a cell wall composed mainly of cellulose is located outside the cell membrane The presence of the cell wall enables the cells of plants fungi and bacteria to exist in hypotonic media without bursting The nucleus in eukaryotes is separated from the cytoplasm by
