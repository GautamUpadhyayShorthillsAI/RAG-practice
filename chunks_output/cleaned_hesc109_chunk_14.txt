special shapes From nature of course Birds and fishes have to move about in fluids all the time Their bodies must have evolved to shapes which would make them lose less energy in overcoming friction Look carefully at the shape of an aeroplane Fig 917 Do you find any similarity in its shape and that of a bird In fact all vehicles are designed to have shapes which reduce fluid friction Fig 917 Similarity in shapes of an aeroplane and a bird Fig 916 Ball bearings reduce friction 202425 SCIENCE 120 KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS KEYWORDS BALL BEARING DRAG FLUID FRICTION FRICTION INTERLOCKING LUBRICANTS ROLLING FRICTION SLIDING FRICTION STATIC FRICTION WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT WHAT YOU HAVE LEARNT Friction opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact It acts on both the surfaces Friction depends on the nature of surfaces in contact For a given pair of surfaces friction depends upon the state of smoothness of
