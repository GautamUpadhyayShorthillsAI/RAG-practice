0 m s1 The average speed of Usha is 3 m s1 and her average velocity is 0 m s1 73 Rate of Change of Velocity During uniform motion of an object along a straight line the velocity remains constant with time In this case the change in velocity of the object for any time interval is zero However in nonuniform motion velocity varies with time It has different values at different instants and at different points of the path Thus the change in velocity of the object during any time interval is not zero Can we now express the change in velocity of an object Activity Activity Activity Activity Activity 77 77 77 77 77 At a time when it is cloudy there may be frequent thunder and lightning The sound of thunder takes some time to reach you after you see the lightning Can you answer why this happens Measure this time interval using a digital wrist watch or a stop watch Calculate the distance of the nearest point of lightning Speed of sound in air 346 m s1 uestions 1 Distinguish between speed and
