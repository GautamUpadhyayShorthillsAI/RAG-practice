these functions the cell needs energy Even when we are eating sleeping or reading we require energy But where does this energy come from Can you say why your parents insist that you should eat regularly The food has stored energy which is released during respiration Therefore all living organisms respire to get energy from food During breathing we breathe in air You know that air contains oxygen We breathe out air which is rich in carbon dioxide The air we breathe in is transported to all parts of the body and ultimately to each cell In the cells oxygen in the air helps in the breakdown of food The process of breakdown of food in the cell with the release of energy is called cellular respiration Cellular respiration takes place in the cells of all organisms In the cell the food glucose is broken down into carbon dioxide and water using oxygen When breakdown of glucose occurs with the use of oxygen it is called aerobic respiration Food can also be broken down without using oxygen This
