and plastids They are important because they carry out some very crucial functions in cells 525 i ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM ER The endoplasmic reticulum ER is a large network of membranebound tubes and sheets It looks like long tubules or round or oblong bags vesicles The ER membrane is similar in structure to the plasma membrane There are two types of ER rough endoplasmic reticulum RER and smooth endoplasmic reticulum SER RER looks rough under a microscope because it has particles called ribosomes attached to its surface The ribosomes which are present in all active cells are the sites of protein manufacture The manufactured proteins are then sent to various places in the cell depending on need using the ER The SER helps in the manufacture of fat molecules or lipids important for cell function Some of these proteins and lipids help in building the cell membrane This process is known as membrane biogenesis Some other proteins and lipids function as enzymes and hormones Although the ER
