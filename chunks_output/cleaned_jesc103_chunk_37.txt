the air Leave these test tubes for a few days and then observe Fig 313 Figure 313 Figure 313 Figure 313 Figure 313 Figure 313 Investigating the conditions under which iron rusts In tube A both air and water are present In tube B there is no air dissolved in the water In tube C the air is dry You will observe that iron nails rust in test tube A but they do not rust in test tubes B and C In the test tube A the nails are exposed to both air and water In the test tube B the nails are exposed to only water and the nails in test tube C are exposed to dry air What does this tell us about the conditions under which iron articles rust Q U E S T I O N S 35 CORROSION 35 CORROSION 35 CORROSION 35 CORROSION 35 CORROSION You have learnt the following about corrosion in Chapter 1 n Silver articles become black after some time when exposed to air This is because it reacts with sulphur in the air to form a coating of silver sulphide n Copper reacts with moist carbon dioxide in the air and slowly loses
