of oxygen it is called aerobic respiration Food can also be broken down without using oxygen This is called anaerobic respiration Breakdown of food releases energy You should know that there are some organisms such as yeast that can survive in the absence of air They are called anaerobes They get energy through anaerobic respiration In the absence of oxygen glucose breaks down into alcohol and carbon dioxide as given below Reprint 202425 SCIENCE 58 Our muscle cells can also respire anaerobically but only for a short time when there is a temporary deficiency of oxygen During heavy exercise fast running Fig 61 cycling walking for many hours or heavy weight lifting the demand for energy is high But the supply of oxygen to produce the energy is limited Then anaerobic respiration takes places in the muscle cells to fulfil the demand of energy Fig 61 During exercise some muscles may respire anaerobically Have you ever wondered why you get muscle cramps after heavy exercise The cramps occur
