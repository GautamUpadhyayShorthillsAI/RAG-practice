than its actual position when viewed near the horizon Fig 109 Further this apparent position of the star is not stationary but keeps on changing slightly since the physical conditions of the earths atmosphere are not stationary as was the case in the previous paragraph Since the stars are very distant they approximate pointsized sources of light As the path of rays of light coming from the star goes on varying slightly the apparent position of the star fluctuates and the amount of starlight entering the eye flickers the star sometimes appears brighter and at some other time fainter which is the twinkling effect Why dont the planets twinkle The planets are much closer to the earth and are thus seen as extended sources If we consider a planet as a collection of a large number of pointsized sources of light the total variation in the amount of light entering our eye from all the individual pointsized sources will average out to zero thereby nullifying the twinkling effect Advance sunrise
