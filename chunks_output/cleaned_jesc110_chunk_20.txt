slightly less than that of the cooler air Since the physical conditions of the refracting medium air are not stationary the apparent position of the object as seen through the hot air fluctuates This wavering is thus an effect of atmospheric refraction refraction of light by the earths atmosphere on a small scale in our local environment The twinkling of stars is a similar phenomenon on a much larger scale Let us see how we can explain it Twinkling of stars The twinkling of a star is due to atmospheric refraction of starlight The starlight on entering the earths atmosphere undergoes refraction continuously before it reaches the earth The atmospheric refraction occurs in a medium of gradually changing refractive index Since the atmosphere bends starlight towards the normal the apparent position of the star is slightly different from its actual position The star appears slightly higher above than its actual position when viewed near the horizon Fig 109 Further this apparent position of
