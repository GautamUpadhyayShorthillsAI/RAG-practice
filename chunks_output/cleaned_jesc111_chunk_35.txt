in devices such as electric heater electric iron etc Consider a current I flowing through a resistor of resistance R Let the potential difference across it be V Fig 1113 Let t be the time during which a charge Q flows across The work done in moving the charge Q through a potential difference V is VQ Therefore the source must supply energy equal to VQ in time t Hence the power input to the circuit by the source is P V VI Q t 1119 Or the energy supplied to the circuit by the source in time t is P t that is VIt What happens to this energy expended by the source This energy gets dissipated in the resistor as heat Thus for a steady current I the amount of heat H produced in time t is H VIt 1120 Q U E S T I O N S 1 Judge the equivalent resistance when the following are connected in parallel a 1 and 106 b 1 and 103 and 106 2 An electric lamp of 100 a toaster of resistance 50 and a water filter of resistance 500 are connected in parallel to a 220 V source What is the resistance of an electric
