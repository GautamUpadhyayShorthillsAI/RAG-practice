shows its constituent elements and the number of atoms of each combining element Clusters of atoms that act as an ion are called polyatomic ions They carry a fixed charge on them The chemical formula of a molecular compound is determined by the valency of each element In ionic compounds the charge on each ion is used to determine the chemical formula of the compound we use the word formula unit for those substances whose constituent particles are ions For example sodium chloride as discussed above has a formula unit NaCl Its formula unit mass can be calculated as 1 23 1 355 585 u Example 32 Calculate the formula unit mass of CaCl2 Solution Atomic mass of Ca 2 atomic mass of Cl 40 2 355 40 71 111 u Q uestions 1 Calculate the molecular masses of H2 O2 Cl2 CO2 CH4 C2H6 C2H4 NH3 CH3OH 2 Calculate the formula unit masses of ZnO Na2O K2CO3 given atomic masses of Zn 65 u Na 23 u K 39 u C 12 u and O 16 u 202425 SCIENCE 36 Group Activity Play a game for writing formulae Example1 Make placards
