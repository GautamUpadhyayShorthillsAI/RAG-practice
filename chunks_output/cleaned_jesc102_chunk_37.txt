reacts with a metal carbonate or metal hydrogencarbonate it gives the corresponding salt carbon dioxide gas and water n Acidic and basic solutions in water conduct electricity because they produce hydrogen and hydroxide ions respectively 202425 Science 34 n The strength of an acid or an alkali can be tested by using a scale called the pH scale 014 which gives the measure of hydrogen ion concentration in a solution n A neutral solution has a pH of exactly 7 while an acidic solution has a pH less than 7 and a basic solution a pH more than 7 n Living beings carry out their metabolic activities within an optimal pH range n Mixing concentrated acids or bases with water is a highly exothermic process n Acids and bases neutralise each other to form corresponding salts and water n Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present in one formula unit of a salt n Salts have various uses in everyday life and in industries E X E R C I S E S 1 A solution turns red litmus blue
