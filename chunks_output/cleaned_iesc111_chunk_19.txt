out that sound travels with a speed which is much less than the speed of light The speed of sound depends on the properties of the medium through which it travels You will learn about this dependence in higher classes The speed of sound in a medium depends on temperature of the medium The speed of sound decreases when we go from solid to gaseous state In any medium as we increase the temperature the speed of sound increases For example the speed of sound in air is 331 m s1 at 0 C and 344 m s1 at 22 C The speeds of sound at a particular temperature in various media are listed in Table 111 You need not memorise the values Table 111 Speed of sound in different media at 25 C State Substance Speed in ms Solids Aluminium 6420 Nickel 6040 Steel 5960 Iron 5950 Brass 4700 Glass Flint 3980 Liquids Water Sea 1531 Water distilled 1498 Ethanol 1207 Methanol 1103 Gases Hydrogen 1284 Helium 965 Air 346 Oxygen 316 Sulphur dioxide 213 Fig 119 Reflection of sound 202425 SCIENCE 134 1131 ECHO If we
