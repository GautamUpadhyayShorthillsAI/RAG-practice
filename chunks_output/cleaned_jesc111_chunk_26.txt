resistor is also I It is possible to replace the three resistors joined in series by an equivalent single resistor of resistance R such that the potential difference V across it and the current I through the circuit remains the same Applying the Ohms law to the entire circuit we have V I R 1112 202425 Science 184 On applying Ohms law to the three resistors separately we further have V1 I R1 1113a V2 I R2 1113b and V3 I R3 1113c From Eq 1111 I R I R1 I R2 I R3 or Rs R1 R2 R3 1114 We can conclude that when several resistors are joined in series the resistance of the combination Rs equals the sum of their individual resistances R1 R2 R3 and is thus greater than any individual resistance Example 117 An electric lamp whose resistance is 20 and a conductor of 4 resistance are connected to a 6 V battery Fig 119 Calculate a the total resistance of the circuit b the current through the circuit and c the potential difference across the electric lamp and conductor Solution The resistance of
