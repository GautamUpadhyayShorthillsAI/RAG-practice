acting on a currentcarrying conductor can be demonstrated through the following activity 3 Choose the correct option The magnetic field inside a long straight solenoidcarrying current a is zero b decreases as we move towards its end c increases as we move towards its end d is the same at all points Activity 127 Activity 127 Activity 127 Activity 127 Activity 127 n Take a small aluminium rod AB of about 5 cm Using two connecting wires suspend it horizontally from a stand as shown in Fig 1212 n Place a strong horseshoe magnet in such a way that the rod lies between the two poles with the magnetic field directed upwards For this put the north pole of the magnet vertically below and south pole vertically above the aluminium rod Fig 1212 n Connect the aluminium rod in series with a battery a key and a rheostat n Now pass a current through the aluminium rod from end B to end A n What do you observe It is observed that the rod is displaced towards the left You will notice that the rod gets
