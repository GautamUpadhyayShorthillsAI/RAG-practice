table You may use a wooden board supported by bricks or books Fig 94 a Put a mark with a pen at any point A on the inclined plane Now let a pencil cell move down from this point How far does it move on the table before coming to rest Note down the distance Now spread a piece of cloth FRICTION 113 202425 SCIENCE 114 Fig 95 Surface irregularities over the table Make sure that there are no wrinkles in the cloth Try the activity again Fig 94 b Does the distance covered depend on the nature of the surface on which the cell moves Could the smoothness of the surface of the cell also affect the distance travelled by it a b Repeat this activity by spreading a thin layer of sand over the table Maintain the same slope throughout the activity In which case is the distance covered the minimum Why is the distance covered by the pencil cell different every time Try to reason why Discuss the result Fig 94 The pencil cell covers different distances on different surfaces I shall try the activity by
