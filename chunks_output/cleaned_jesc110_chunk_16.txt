exciting phenomenon Let us find it out through an activity PE Incident ray i Angle of incidence EF Refracted ray r Angle of refraction FS Emergent ray e Angle of emergence A Angle of the prism D Angle of deviation Figure 104 Figure 104 Figure 104 Figure 104 Figure 104 Refraction of light through a triangular glass prism 202425 The Human Eye and the Colourful World 167 The prism has probably split the incident white light into a band of colours Note the colours that appear at the two ends of the colour band What is the sequence of colours that you see on the screen The various colours seen are Violet Indigo Blue Green Yellow Orange and Red as shown in Fig 105 The acronym VIBGYOR will help you to remember the sequence of colours The band of the coloured components of a light beam is called its spectrum You might not be able to see all the colours separately Yet something makes each colour distinct from the other The splitting of light into its component colours is called dispersion You
