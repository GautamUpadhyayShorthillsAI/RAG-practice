the object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time it is said to be in uniform motion The time interval in this motion should be small In our daytoday life we come across motions where objects cover unequal distances in equal intervals of time for example when a car is moving on a crowded street or a person is jogging in a park These are some instances of nonuniform motion Activity 75 The data regarding the motion of two different objects A and B are given in Table 71 Examine them carefully and state whether the motion of the objects is uniform or nonuniform Q a b Fig 72 Table 71 Time Distance Distance travelled by travelled by object A in m object B in m 930 am 10 12 945 am 20 19 1000 am 30 23 1015 am 40 35 1030 am 50 37 1045 am 60 41 1100 am 70 44 72 Measuring the Rate of Motion 202425 MOTION 75 Look at the situations given in Fig 72 If the bowling speed is 143 km h1 in Fig 72a what does it mean What do you understand from the signboard in Fig 72b Different objects may
