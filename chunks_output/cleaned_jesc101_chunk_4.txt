Activity 11 can be described as when a magnesium ribbon is burnt in oxygen it gets converted to magnesium oxide This description of a chemical reaction in a sentence form is quite long It can be written in a shorter form The simplest way to do this is to write it in the form of a wordequation The wordequation for the above reaction would be Magnesium Oxygen Magnesium oxide 11 Reactants Product The substances that undergo chemical change in the reaction 11 magnesium and oxygen are the reactants The new substance is magnesium oxide formed during the reaction as a product A wordequation shows change of reactants to products through an arrow placed between them The reactants are written on the lefthand side LHS with a plus sign between them Similarly products are written on the righthand side RHS with a plus sign between them The arrowhead points towards the products and shows the direction of the reaction You must have observed that magnesium ribbon burns with a dazzling white flame and
