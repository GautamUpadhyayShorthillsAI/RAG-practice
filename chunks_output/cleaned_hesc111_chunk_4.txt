or vinegar conduct electricity How would you classify lemon juice or vinegar a good conductor or a poor conductor When the liquid between the two ends of the tester allows the electric current to pass the circuit of the tester becomes complete The current flows in the circuit and the bulb glows When the liquid does not allow the electric current to pass the circuit of the tester is not complete and the bulb does not glow In some situations even though the liquid is conducting the bulb may not glow It may have happened in Activity 112 What can be the reason Do you remember why the bulb glows when the electric current passes through it Due to the heating effect of current the filament of the bulb gets heated to a high temperature and it starts glowing However if the current through a circuit is too weak the filament does not get heated CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC CURRENT 139 202425 SCIENCE 140 Activity 113 Take the tray from inside a discarded matchbox Wrap an electric wire a few times
