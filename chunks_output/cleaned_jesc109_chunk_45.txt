letter f is used to represent the focal length How can you find the focal length of a convex lens Recall the Activity 911 In this Activity the distance between the position of the lens and the position of the image of the Sun gives the approximate focal length of the lens 202425 Science 152 934 Image Formation by Lenses Lenses form images by refracting light How do lenses form images What is their nature Let us study this for a convex lens first Activity 912 Activity 912 Activity 912 Activity 912 Activity 912 n Take a convex lens Find its approximate focal length in a way described in Activity 911 n Draw five parallel straight lines using chalk on a long Table such that the distance between the successive lines is equal to the focal length of the lens n Place the lens on a lens stand Place it on the central line such that the optical centre of the lens lies just over the line n The two lines on either side of the lens correspond to F and 2F of the lens respectively Mark them with
