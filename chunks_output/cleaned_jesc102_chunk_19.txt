has been developed The p in pH stands for potenz in German meaning power On the pH scale we can measure pH generally from 0 very acidic to 14 very alkaline pH should be thought of simply as a number which indicates the acidic or basic nature of a solution Higher the hydronium ion concentration lower is the pH value The pH of a neutral solution is 7 Values less than 7 on the pH scale represent an acidic solution As the pH value increases from 7 to 14 it represents an increase in OH ion concentration in the solution that is increase in the strength of alkali Fig 26 Generally paper impregnated with the universal indicator is used for measuring pH Q U E S T I O N S 1 Why do HCl HNO3 etc show acidic characters in aqueous solutions while solutions of compounds like alcohol and glucose do not show acidic character 2 Why does an aqueous solution of an acid conduct electricity 3 Why does dry HCl gas not change the colour of the dry litmus paper 4 While diluting an acid why is it recommended
