hydrocarbon portion out of the water Thus clusters of molecules in which the hydrophobic tails are in the interior of the cluster and the ionic ends are on the surface of the cluster This formation is called a micelle Soap in the form of a micelle is able to clean since the oily dirt will be collected in the centre of the micelle The micelles stay in solution as a colloid and will not come together to precipitate because of ionion repulsion Thus the dirt suspended in the micelles is also easily rinsed away The soap micelles are large enough to scatter light Hence a soap solution appears cloudy Figure 413 Figure 413 Figure 413 Figure 413 Figure 413 Effect of soap in cleaning More to Know 202425 Science 76 Activity 411 Activity 411 Activity 411 Activity 411 Activity 411 n Take about 10 mL of distilled water or rain water and 10 mL of hard water from a tubewell or handpump in separate test tubes n Add a couple of drops of soap solution to both n Shake the test tubes vigorously for an
