current is passed through the copper sulphate solution copper sulphate dissociates into copper and sulphate The free copper gets drawn to the electrode connected to the negative terminal of the battery and gets deposited on it But what about the loss of copper from the solution From the other electrode a copper plate an equal amount of copper gets dissolved in the solution Thus the After doing the electroplating activity Paheli interchanged the electrodes and repeated the activity What do you think she would observe this time Fig117 A simple circuit showing electroplating Copper plate Copper sul phate solution Copper plate 202425 CHEMICAL EFFECTS OF ELECTRIC CURRENT 145 loss of copper from the solution is restored and the process continues This means that copper gets transferred from one electrode to the other In the electroplating factories the disposal of the used conducting solution is a major concern It is a polluting waste and there are specific disposal guidelines to protect the
