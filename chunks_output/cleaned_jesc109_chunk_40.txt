bulging outwards Such a lens is called a double convex lens It is simply called a convex lens It is thicker at the middle as compared to the edges Convex lens converges light rays as shown in Fig 912 a Hence convex lenses are also called converging lenses Similarly a double concave lens is bounded by two spherical surfaces curved inwards It is thicker at the edges than at the middle Such lenses diverge light rays as shown in Fig 912 b Such lenses are also called diverging lenses A double concave lens is simply called a concave lens A lens either a convex lens or a concave lens has two spherical surfaces Each of these surfaces forms a part of a sphere The centres of these spheres are called centres of curvature of the lens The centre of curvature of a lens is usually represented by the letter C Since there are two centres of curvature we may represent them as C1 and C2 An imaginary straight line passing through the two centres of curvature of a lens is called its principal axis The
