and water are known as amphoteric oxides Aluminium oxide reacts in the following manner with acids and bases Al2O3 6HCl 2AlCl3 3H2O Al2O3 2NaOH 2NaAlO2 H2O Sodium aluminate Most metal oxides are insoluble in water but some of these dissolve in water to form alkalis Sodium oxide and potassium oxide dissolve in water to produce alkalis as follows Na2Os H2Ol 2NaOHaq K2Os H2Ol 2KOHaq 202425 Science 42 We have observed in Activity 39 that all metals do not react with oxygen at the same rate Different metals show different reactivities towards oxygen Metals such as potassium and sodium react so vigorously that they catch fire if kept in the open Hence to protect them and to prevent accidental fires they are kept immersed in kerosene oil At ordinary temperature the surfaces of metals such as magnesium aluminium zinc lead etc are covered with a thin layer of oxide The protective oxide layer prevents the metal from further oxidation Iron does not burn on heating but iron filings burn
