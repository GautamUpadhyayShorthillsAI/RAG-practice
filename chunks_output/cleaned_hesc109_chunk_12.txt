luggage Fig 914 Why is it so Let us find out Can we reduce friction to zero by polishing surfaces or using large amount of lubricants Friction can never be entirely eleminated No surface is perfectly smooth Some irregularities are always there Fig 915 Motion of the book on rollers When one body rolls over the surface of another body the resistance to its motion is called rolling friction Rolling reduces friction It is always easier to roll than to slide a body over another That is the reason it is convenient to pull luggage fitted with rollers Can you now understand why the wheel is said to be one of the greatest inventions of mankind Since the rolling friction is smaller than the sliding friction sliding is replaced in most machines by rolling by the use of ball bearings Common examples are the use of ball bearings between hubs and the axles of ceiling fans and bicycles Fig 916 Fig 914 Rolling reduces friction 202425 FRICTION 119 96 Fluid Friction You know that air is very light and
