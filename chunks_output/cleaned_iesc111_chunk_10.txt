February 1857 in Hamburg Germany and educated at the University of Berlin He confirmed JC Maxwells electromagnetic theory by his experiments He laid the foundation for future development of radio telephone telegraph and even television He also discovered the photoelectric effect which was later explained by Albert Einstein The SI unit of frequency was named as hertz in his honour Fig 116b represent the density and pressure variations respectively as a sound wave propagates in the medium Compressions are the regions where particles are crowded together and represented by the upper portion of the curve in Fig 116c The peak represents the region of maximum compression Thus compressions are regions where density as well as pressure is high Rarefactions are the regions of low pressure where particles are spread apart and are represented by the valley that is the lower portion of the curve in Fig 116c A peak is called the crest and a valley is called the trough of a wave The distance
