133 Activity 76 Let us compare Phibans Science teacher arranged the experimental setup for measuring temperature of boiling water The temperature readings of the boiling water taken by Phiban and her classmates in Shillong are given in Table 72 Table 72 Temperature of boiling water Name Temperature of boiling water in C Phiban 978 Shemphang 980 Onestar 979 Kloi 980 Bandarisha 981 Following two experimental setups are to be arranged by your teacher One by one as per your turn go closer to the setups and observe the readings of both the thermometers What are the temperatures of ice and boiling water Read the temperatures of ice and boiling water again after some time Are the temperatures same or have changed You may have noticed that the temperature of water remains constant while it is boiling Also the temperature of ice remains constant while it is melting More to do Laboratory thermometer Laboratory thermometer Crushed ice Boiling water Burner Caution This activity should be
