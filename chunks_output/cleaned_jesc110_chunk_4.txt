eye lens can thus change its focal length When the muscles are relaxed the lens becomes thin Thus its focal length increases This enables us to see distant objects clearly When you are looking at objects closer to the eye the ciliary muscles contract This increases the curvature of the eye lens The eye lens then becomes thicker Consequently the focal length of the eye lens decreases This enables us to see nearby objects clearly The ability of the eye lens to adjust its focal length is called accommodation However the focal length of the eye lens cannot be decreased below a certain minimum limit Try to read a printed page by holding it very close to your eyes You may see the image being blurred or feel strain in the eye To see an object comfortably and distinctly you must hold it at about 25 cm from the eyes The minimum distance at which objects can be seen most distinctly without strain is called the least distance of distinct vision It is also called the near point of the eye For a
