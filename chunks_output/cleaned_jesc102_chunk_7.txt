acid and testing hydrogen gas by burning 202425 Science 20 Note that the metal in the above reactions displaces hydrogen atoms from the acids as hydrogen gas and forms a compound called a salt Thus the reaction of a metal with an acid can be summarised as Acid Metal Salt Hydrogen gas Can you now write the equations for the reactions you have observed Activity 24 Activity 24 Activity 24 Activity 24 Activity 24 The reactions occurring in the above Activity are written as Test tube A Na CO HClaq Claq H Ol CO 2 3 2 2 s Na g 2 2 Test tube B NaHCO HClaq Claq H Ol CO 3 2 2 s Na g On passing the carbon dioxide gas evolved through lime water CaOH CO H Ol 2 2 2 aq g CaCO s 3 Lime water White precipitate n Place a few pieces of granulated zinc metal in a test tube n Add 2 mL of sodium hydroxide solution and warm the contents of the test tube n Repeat the rest of the steps as in Activity 23 and record your observations The reaction that takes place can be written as follows 2NaOHaq Zns Na2ZnO2s
