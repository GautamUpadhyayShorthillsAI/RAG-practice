glass tumbler We must NEVER put a sharp pointed or hard thing into our ear It can damage the eardrum The damaged eardrum can impair hearing 105 Amplitude Time Period and Frequency of a Vibration We have learnt that the to and fro motion of an object is known as vibration This motion is also called oscillatory motion Eardrum Inner ear 202425 SOUND 131 Hear the sound produced Now bang the spoon on the tumbler and hear the sound produced again Is the sound louder when the tumbler is struck hard Now suspend a small thermocol ball touching the rim of the tumbler Fig 1017 Vibrate the tumbler by striking it See how far the ball is displaced The displacement of the ball is a measure of the amplitude of vibration of the tumbler Now strike the tumbler gently and then a little harder Compare the amplitudes of vibrations of the tumbler in the two cases In which case is the amplitude larger Loudness of sound is proportional to the square of the amplitude of the vibration producing the sound For
