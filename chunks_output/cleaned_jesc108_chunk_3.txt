represent the situation if a single individual reproduces as happens in asexual reproduction If one bacterium divides and then the resultant two bacteria divide again the four individual bacteria generated would be very similar There would be only very minor differences between them generated due to small inaccuracies in DNA copying However if sexual reproduction is involved even greater diversity will be generated as we will see when we discuss the rules of inheritance Do all these variations in a species have equal chances of surviving in the environment in which they find themselves Obviously not Depending on the nature of variations different individuals would have 202425 Heredity 129 82 HEREDITY 82 HEREDITY 82 HEREDITY 82 HEREDITY 82 HEREDITY The most obvious outcome of the reproductive process still remains the generation of individuals of similar design The rules of heredity determine the process by which traits and characteristics are reliably inherited Let us take a closer
