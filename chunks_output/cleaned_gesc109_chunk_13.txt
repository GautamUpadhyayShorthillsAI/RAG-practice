a ball along the ground in a direction perpendicular to the line Note the time at the moment the ball crosses the line and also when it comes to rest Fig 96 How much time does the ball take to come to rest The smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly available clocks and watches is one second However now special clocks are available that can measure time intervals smaller than a second Some of these clocks can measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a second You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond One microsecond is one millionth of a second A nanosecond is one billionth of a second Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific research The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals that are one tenth or one hundredth of a second On the other hand times of historical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums The ages of stars and planet are often
