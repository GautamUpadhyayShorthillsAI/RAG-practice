have connections with the membranes of ER and therefore constitute another portion of a complex cellular membrane system The material synthesised near the ER is packaged and dispatched to various targets inside and outside the cell through the Golgi apparatus Its functions include the storage modification and packaging of products in vesicles In some cases complex sugars may be made from simple sugars in the Golgi apparatus The Golgi apparatus is also involved in the formation of lysosomes see 525 iii 202425 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE 57 damaged lysosomes may burst and the enzymes digest their own cell Therefore lysosomes are also known as the suicide bags of a cell 525 iv MITOCHONDRIA Mitochondria are known as the powerhouses of the cell Mitochondria have two membrane coverings The outer membrane is porous while the inner membrane is deeply folded These folds increase surface area for ATP generating chemical reactions The energy required for various chemical activities needed for
