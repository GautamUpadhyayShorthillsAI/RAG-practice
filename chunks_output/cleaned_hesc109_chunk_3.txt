force Note down the reading on the spring balance when the brick just begins to move It gives you a measure of the force of friction between the surface of the brick and the floor for this difference Repeat this activity by wrapping a piece of jute bag around the brick What do you observe Fig 93 A brick is being pulled by spring balance Now wrap a piece of polythene around the brick and repeat the activity Do you observe any difference in the readings of the spring balance in the above two cases What might be the reason Spring Balance Spring balance is a device used for measuring the force acting on an object It consists of a coiled spring which gets stretched when a force is applied to it Stretching of the spring is measured by a pointer moving on a graduated scale The reading on the scale gives the magnitude of the force Activity 93 Make an inclined plane on a smooth floor or on a table You may use a wooden board supported by bricks or books Fig 94 a Put a mark with a pen at any
