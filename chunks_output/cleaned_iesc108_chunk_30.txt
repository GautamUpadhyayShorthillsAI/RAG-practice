cart and one on another cart The second law of motion can be seen as this arrangement would show different accelerations for the same force The cart shown in this activity can be constructed by using a 12 mm or 18 mm thick plywood board of about 50 cm 100 cm with two pairs of hard ballbearing wheels skate wheels are good to use Skateboards are not as effective because it is difficult to maintain straightline motion 202425 FORCE AND LAWS OF MOTION 97 The SI unit of force is kg m s2 This is also known as newton and represented by the symbol N A force of one newton produces an acceleration of 1 m s2 on an object of mass 1 kg The momentum of an object is the product of its mass and velocity and has the same direction as that of the velocity Its SI unit is kg m s1 Third law of motion To every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and they act on two different bodies Exercises 1 An object experiences a net zero external unbalanced force Is it possible for the object to be
