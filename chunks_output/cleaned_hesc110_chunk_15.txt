produced is feeble The frequency determines the shrillness or pitch of a sound If the frequency of vibration is higher we say that the sound is shrill and has a higher pitch If the frequency of vibration is lower we say that the sound has a lower pitch For example a drum vibrates with a low frequency Therefore it produces 202425 SCIENCE 132 a lowpitched sound On the other hand a whistle has a high frequency and therefore produces a sound of higher pitch Fig 1018 A bird makes a highpitched sound whereas a lion makes a lowpitched roar However the roar of a lion is very loud while the sound of the bird is quite feeble Every day you hear the voices of children and adults Do you find any difference in their voices Can you say that the frequency of the voice of a child is higher than that of an adult Usually the voice of a woman has a higher frequency than that of a man 106 Audible and Inaudible Sounds We know that we need a vibrating body for the production of sound Can we hear the sound
