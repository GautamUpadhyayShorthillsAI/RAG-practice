the larval stage comes before the pupal stage or viceversa Step 5 I will keep watching both the containers to see in which one a mosquito appears first These observations will help us to learn the correct sequence of growth Now suppose you are given a container filled with water from a puddle which contains larvae and pupae Without separating them from the container how would you design an activity to decide which stage out of the two gives way to the next My design Fig 106 Life cycle of a mosquito Stage IV Adult mosquito Stage I Egg Stage III Pupa Stage II Larva Let us learn more about these stages in the life cycle of a mosquito Mosquitoes pass through four stages in their life cycle egg larva pupa and adult Fig 106 The adult mosquito that emerges from the pupa rests briefly on the surface of water and then flies away The adult mosquito may survive for 10 to 15 days We have seen that a mosquito begins its life as an egg stage I the egg develops into a larva stage II the larva grows
