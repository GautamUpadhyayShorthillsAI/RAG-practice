of copper powder becomes coated with black copperII oxide Why has this black substance formed This is because oxygen is added to copper and copper oxide is formed 2Cu O2 Heat 2CuO 128 If hydrogen gas is passed over this heated material CuO the black coating on the surface turns brown as the reverse reaction takes place and copper is obtained CuO H CuH O 2 2 Heat 129 If a substance gains oxygen during a reaction it is said to be oxidised If a substance loses oxygen during a reaction it is said to be reduced During this reaction 129 the copperII oxide is losing oxygen and is being reduced The hydrogen is gaining oxygen and is being oxidised In other words one reactant gets oxidised while the other gets reduced during a reaction Such reactions are called oxidationreduction reactions or redox reactions 130 Some other examples of redox reactions are ZnO C Zn CO 131 MnO HCl MnCl H O Cl 2 2 2 2 4 2 132 Recall Activity 12 Recall Activity 12 Recall Activity 12 Recall Activity 12 Recall
