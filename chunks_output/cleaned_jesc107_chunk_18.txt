errors are a source of variations in populations of organisms Every individual organism cannot be protected by variations but in a population variations are useful for ensuring the survival of the species It would therefore make sense if organisms came up with reproductive modes that allowed more and more variation to be generated While DNAcopying mechanisms are not absolutely accurate they are precise enough to make the generation of variation a fairly slow process If the DNA copying mechanisms were to be less accurate many of the resultant DNA copies would not be able to work with the cellular apparatus and would die So how can the process of making variants be speeded up Each new variation is made in a DNA copy that already has variations accumulated from previous generations Thus two different individuals in a population would have quite different patterns of accumulated variations Since all of these variations are in living individuals it is assured that they do not have any
