These oxides are known as amphoteric oxides n Different metals have different reactivities with water and dilute acids n A list of common metals arranged in order of their decreasing reactivity is known as an activity series n Metals above hydrogen in the Activity series can displace hydrogen from dilute acids n A more reactive metal displaces a less reactive metal from its salt solution n Metals occur in nature as free elements or in the form of their compounds n The extraction of metals from their ores and then refining them for use is known as metallurgy n An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals or a metal and a nonmetal n The surface of some metals such as iron is corroded when they are exposed to moist air for a long period of time This phenomenon is known as corrosion n Nonmetals have properties opposite to that of metals They are neither malleable nor ductile They are bad conductors of heat and electricity except for graphite which conducts electricity 202425
