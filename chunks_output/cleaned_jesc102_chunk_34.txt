of copper sulphate restored Figure 29 Figure 29 Figure 29 Figure 29 Figure 29 Removing water of crystallisation Copper sulphate crystals which seem to be dry contain water of crystallisation When we heat the crystals this water is removed and the salt turns white If you moisten the crystals again with water you will find that blue colour of the crystals reappears Water of crystallisation is the fixed number of water molecules present in one formula unit of a salt Five water molecules are present in one formula unit of copper sulphate Chemical formula for hydrated copper sulphate is Cu SO4 5H2O Now you would be able to answer the question whether the molecule of Na2CO310H2O is wet One other salt which possesses water of crystallisation is gypsum It has two water molecules as water of cyrstallisation It has the chemical formula CaSO42H2O Let us look into the use of this salt Plaster of Paris On heating gypsum at 373 K it loses water molecules and becomes calcium sulphate hemihydrate 4 2
