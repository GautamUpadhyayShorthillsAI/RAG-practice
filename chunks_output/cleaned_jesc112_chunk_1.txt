Magnetic Effects of Electric Current 12 CHAPTER I n the previous Chapter on Electricity we learnt about the heating effects of electric current What could be the other effects of electric current We know that an electric currentcarrying wire behaves like a magnet Let us perform the following Activity to reinforce it Activity 121 Activity 121 Activity 121 Activity 121 Activity 121 n Take a straight thick copper wire and place it between the points X and Y in an electric circuit as shown in Fig 121 The wire XY is kept perpendicular to the plane of paper n Horizontally place a small compass near to this copper wire See the position of its needle n Pass the current through the circuit by inserting the key into the plug n Observe the change in the position of the compass needle Figure 121 Figure 121 Figure 121 Figure 121 Figure 121 Compass needle is deflected on passing an electric current through a metallic conductor We see that the needle is deflected What does it mean It means that the
