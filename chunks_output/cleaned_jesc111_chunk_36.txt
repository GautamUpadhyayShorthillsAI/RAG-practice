of resistance 500 are connected in parallel to a 220 V source What is the resistance of an electric iron connected to the same source that takes as much current as all three appliances and what is the current through it 3 What are the advantages of connecting electrical devices in parallel with the battery instead of connecting them in series 4 How can three resistors of resistances 2 3 and 6 be connected to give a total resistance of a 4 b 1 5 What is a the highest b the lowest total resistance that can be secured by combinations of four coils of resistance 4 8 12 24 202425 Electricity 189 Applying Ohms law Eq 115 we get H I2 Rt 1121 This is known as Joules law of heating The law implies that heat produced in a resistor is i directly proportional to the square of current for a given resistance ii directly proportional to resistance for a given current and iii directly proportional to the time for which the current flows through the resistor In practical situations when an electric
