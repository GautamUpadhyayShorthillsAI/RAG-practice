contains many specialised cell organelles Each of these organelles performs a specific function for the cell Cell organelles are enclosed by membranes In prokaryotes beside the absence of a defined nuclear region the membranebound cell organelles are also absent On the other hand the eukaryotic cells have nuclear membrane as well as membraneenclosed organelles The significance of membranes can be illustrated with the example of viruses Viruses lack any membranes and hence do not show characteristics of life until they enter a living body and use its cell machinery to multiply 202425 THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT OF LIFE 55 uestion 1 Fill in the gaps in the following table illustrating differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells Prokaryotic Cell Eukaryotic Cell 1 Size generally 1 Size generally small 110 m large 5100 m 1 m 106 m 2 Nuclear region 2 Nuclear region well defined and surrounded by a and known as nuclear membrane 3 Chromosome 3 More than one single chromosome 4 Membranebound
