that travels obliquely from one transparent medium into another will change its direction in the second medium The extent of the change in direction that takes place in a given pair of media may be expressed in terms of the refractive index the constant appearing on the righthand side of Eq94 The refractive index can be linked to an important physical quantity the relative speed of propagation of light in different media It turns out that light propagates with different speeds in different media Light travels fastest in vacuum with speed of 3108 m s1 In air the speed of light is only marginally less compared to that in vacuum It reduces considerably in glass or water The value of the refractive index for a given pair of media depends upon the speed of light in the two media as given below Consider a ray of light travelling from medium 1 into medium 2 as shown in Fig911 Let v1 be the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 be the speed of light in medium 2 The refractive index of medium 2
