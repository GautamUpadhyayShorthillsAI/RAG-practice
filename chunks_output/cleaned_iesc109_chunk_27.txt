as follows Activity 96 Take a beaker filled with water Take a piece of cork and an iron nail of equal mass Place them on the surface of water Observe what happens The cork floats while the nail sinks This happens because of the difference in their densities The density of a substance is defined as the mass per unit volume The density of cork is less than the density of water This means that the upthrust of water on the cork is greater than the weight of the cork So it floats Fig 95 The density of an iron nail is more than the density of water This means that the upthrust of water on the iron nail is less than the weight of the nail So it sinks Therefore objects of density less than that of a liquid float on the liquid The objects of density greater than that of a liquid sink in the liquid uestions 1 Why is it difficult to hold a school bag having a strap made of a thin and strong string 2 What do you mean by buoyancy 3 Why does an object float or sink when placed on the surface of
