sucked into the lungs and fills the expanded alveoli The blood brings carbon dioxide from the rest of the body for release into the alveoli and the oxygen in the alveolar air is taken up by blood in the alveolar blood vessels to be transported to all the cells in the body During the breathing cycle when air is taken in and let out the lungs always contain a residual volume of air so that there is sufficient time for oxygen to be absorbed and for the carbon dioxide to be released When the body size of animals is large the diffusion pressure alone cannot take care of oxygen delivery to all parts of the body Instead respiratory pigments take up oxygen from the air in the lungs and carry it to tissues which are deficient in oxygen before releasing it In human beings the respiratory pigment is haemoglobin which has a very high affinity for oxygen This pigment is present in the red blood corpuscles Carbon dioxide is more soluble in water than oxygen is and hence is mostly transported in the
