reaction forces are always equal in magnitude these forces may not produce accelerations of equal magnitudes This is because each force acts on a different object that may have a different mass When a gun is fired it exerts a forward force on the bullet The bullet exerts an equal and opposite force on the gun This results in the recoil of the gun Fig 811 Since the gun has a much greater mass than the bullet the acceleration of the gun is much less than the acceleration of the bullet The third law of motion can also be illustrated when a sailor jumps out of a rowing boat As the sailor jumps forward the force on the boat moves it backwards Fig 812 Fig 811 A forward force on the bullet and recoil of the gun 202425 SCIENCE 96 What you have learnt First law of motion An object continues to be in a state of rest or of uniform motion along a straight line unless acted upon by an unbalanced force The natural tendency of objects to resist a change in their state of rest or of uniform motion is
