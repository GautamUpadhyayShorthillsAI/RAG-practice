322 ATOMIC MASS The most remarkable concept that Daltons atomic theory proposed was that of the atomic mass According to him each element had a characteristic atomic mass The theory could explain the law of constant proportions so well that scientists were prompted to measure the atomic mass of an atom Since determining the mass of an individual atom was a relatively difficult task relative atomic masses were determined using the laws of chemical combinations and the compounds formed Let us take the example of a compound carbon monoxide CO formed by carbon and oxygen It was observed experimentally that 3 g of carbon combines with 4 g of oxygen to form CO In other words carbon combines with 43 times its mass of oxygen Suppose we define the atomic mass unit earlier abbreviated as amu but according to the latest IUPAC recommendations it is now written as u unified mass as equal to the mass of one carbon atom then we would assign carbon an atomic mass of 10 u and oxygen an atomic mass of
