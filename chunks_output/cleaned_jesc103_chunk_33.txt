metals such as sodium calcium aluminium etc are used as reducing 202425 Science 52 agents because they can displace metals of lower reactivity from their compounds For example when manganese dioxide is heated with aluminium powder the following reaction takes place 3MnO2s 4Als 3Mnl 2Al2O3s Heat Can you identify the substances that are getting oxidised and reduced These displacement reactions are highly exothermic The amount of heat evolved is so large that the metals are produced in the molten state In fact the reaction of ironIII oxide Fe2O3 with aluminium is used to join railway tracks or cracked machine parts This reaction is known as the thermit reaction Fe2O3s 2Als 2Fel Al2O3s Heat 345 Extracting Metals towards the Top of the Activity Series The metals high up in the reactivity series are very reactive They cannot be obtained from their compounds by heating with carbon For example carbon cannot reduce the oxides of sodium magnesium calcium aluminium etc to the respective metals
