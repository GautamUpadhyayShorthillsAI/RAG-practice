and why 202425 GRAVITATION 111 All objects experience a force of buoyancy when they are immersed in a fluid Objects having density less than that of the liquid in which they are immersed float on the surface of the liquid If the density of the object is more than the density of the liquid in which it is immersed then it sinks in the liquid Exercises 1 How does the force of gravitation between two objects change when the distance between them is reduced to half 2 Gravitational force acts on all objects in proportion to their masses Why then a heavy object does not fall faster than a light object 3 What is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the earth and a 1 kg object on its surface Mass of the earth is 6 1024 kg and radius of the earth is 64 106 m 4 The earth and the moon are attracted to each other by gravitational force Does the earth attract the moon with a force that is greater or smaller or the same as the force with which the moon attracts the earth Why 5 If the
