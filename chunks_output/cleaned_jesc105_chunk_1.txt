Life Processes 5 CHAPTER H ow do we tell the difference between what is alive and what is not alive If we see a dog running or a cow chewing cud or a man shouting loudly on the street we know that these are living beings What if the dog or the cow or the man were asleep We would still think that they were alive but how did we know that We see them breathing and we know that they are alive What about plants How do we know that they are alive We see them green some of us will say But what about plants that have leaves of colours other than green They grow over time so we know that they are alive some will say In other words we tend to think of some sort of movement either growthrelated or not as common evidence for being alive But a plant that is not visibly growing is still alive and some animals can breathe without visible movement So using visible movement as the defining characteristic of life is not enough Movements over very small scales will be invisible to the naked eye movements
