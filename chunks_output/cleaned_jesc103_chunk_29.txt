as their sulphide or oxide ores The metals at the top of the activity series K Na Ca Mg and Al are so reactive that they are never found in nature as free elements The metals in the middle of the activity series Zn Fe Pb etc are moderately reactive They are found in the earths crust mainly as oxides sulphides or carbonates You will find that the ores of many metals are oxides This is because oxygen is a very reactive element and is very abundant on the earth Thus on the basis of reactivity we can group the metals into the following three categories Fig 39 i Metals of low reactivity ii Metals of medium reactivity iii Metals of high reactivity Different techniques are to be used for obtaining the metals falling in each category K Na Ca Mg Al Zn Fe Pb Cu Ag Au Reduction using carbon Found in native state Electrolysis Figure 39 Figure 39 Figure 39 Figure 39 Figure 39 Activity series and related metallurgy Figure 310 Figure 310 Figure 310 Figure 310 Figure 310 Steps involved in the
