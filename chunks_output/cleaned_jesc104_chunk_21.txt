some groups as given in Table 43 These heteroatoms and the group containing these confer specific properties to the compound regardless of the length and nature of the carbon chain and hence are called functional groups Some important functional groups are given in the Table 43 Free valency or valencies of the group are shown by the single line The functional group is attached to the carbon chain through this valency by replacing one hydrogen atom or atoms 424 Homologous Series You have seen that carbon atoms can be linked together to form chains of varying lengths These chains can be branched also In addition hydrogen atom or other atoms on these carbon chains can be replaced by any of the functional groups that we saw above The presence of a functional group such as alcohol decides the properties of the carbon compound regardless of the length of the carbon chain For example the chemical properties of CH3OH C2H5OH C3H7OH and C4H9OH are all very similar Hence such a series of
