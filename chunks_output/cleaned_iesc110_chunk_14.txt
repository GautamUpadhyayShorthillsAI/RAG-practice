mass on the pan In which case is the displacement more In which case is the work done more In this activity the moving trolley does work and hence it possesses energy A moving object can do work An object moving faster can do more work than an identical object moving relatively slow A moving bullet blowing wind a rotating wheel a speeding stone can do work How does a bullet pierce the target How does the wind move the blades of a windmill Objects in motion possess energy We call this energy kinetic energy A falling coconut a speeding car a rolling stone a flying aircraft flowing water blowing wind a running athlete etc possess kinetic energy In short kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion The kinetic energy of an object increases with its speed How much energy is possessed by a moving body by virtue of its motion By definition we say that the kinetic energy of a body moving with a certain velocity is equal to the work done on it to make it acquire that
