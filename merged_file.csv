What are the two types of stresses that can affect crop production?,"Biotic and abiotic resistance: Crops production can go down due to biotic (diseases, insects and nematodes) and abiotic (drought, salinity, water logging, heat, cold and frost) stresses under different situations. Varieties resistant to these stresses can improve crop production. nan nan nan nan"
Give examples of biotic stresses.,"Biotic stresses include diseases caused by pathogens, infestations by insects, and attacks by nematodes, all of which can harm crop plants. nan nan nan nan"
Give examples of abiotic stresses.,"Biotic stresses encompass environmental challenges such as drought, salinity, water logging, heat, cold and frost, which can impede crop growth and development. nan nan nan nan"
How can varieties resistant to stresses improve crop production?,"Biotic and abiotic resistance: Crops production can go down due to biotic (diseases, insects and nematodes) and abiotic (drought, salinity, water logging, heat, cold and frost) stresses under different situations.

What is the advantage of a shorter maturity duration for crops?,"Change in maturity duration: The shorter the duration of the crop from sowing to harvesting, the more economical is the variety. nan nan nan nan"
What does short duration allow farmers to do?,Such short durations allow farmers to grow multiple rounds of crops in a year. Short duration also reduces the cost of crop production. Uniform maturity makes the harvesting process easy and reduces losses during harvesting. nan nan nan nan
